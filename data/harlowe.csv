Update to video: I do think Dylan has been found since I recorded this, however I can't figure out the specifics of where he was or what happened to him, as there is no print news coverage of it, I only found one YouTube video that shows him being brought home. So if any of you have more info on what happened to Dylan, and if it was connected to those 23 children, please let me know in the comments. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch2ZEvLhIfg

I recorded this video this past Friday. Since then, more information has come out. Although I will be doing an update to this video to include the new information, in my opinion it changes some of the facts, but not my ultimate belief which this never should have happened, and was easily avoidable. Clearly there is something wrong with Georgia Law, and citizens have no business making arrests unless they witness a violent crime. There was no need for this.

454,The Tan Children Murders,2018-09-03,265710,10427,1057.0,"Welcome back to Mystery Monday

This is a sad case, and one that was hard for me to get through and talk about.

In 1979, four children were senselessly murdered.... here is their story.

The more we raise awareness about these cases, the more we keep them in our minds, the more likely that someone somewhere might hear, see or find out something that could crack the case.

468,The Ordinary Lactic Acid: Anti Aging Powerhouse!,2018-07-27,16694,436,,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% plus HA 

If you are struggling with skin issues such as acne, fine lines, hyperpigmentation or just dull, lifeless skin, you may want to check this video out. 

I believe that this Lactic Acid from The Ordinary is one of the best, most reasonably priced formulas to help all of the above skincare issues. 

I am a big fan of The Ordinary, and in this series we go into ONE of their products each week, to keep it simple and stripped down, and to not overwhelm the viewer with multiple products in one video. 

This week, we are talking about Lactic Acid. I have used this product for 4 months before making this video so I was able to get a good idea of its benefits, and any possible side effects.

Thank you so much for watching! Let me know in the comments if you have used this as well, or another lactic acid product, and what you thought. Also Subscribe for more videos on skincare and beauty, and check out my playlist, The Ordinary Series, for more videos on The Ordinary Products!

490,GLAMGLOW SUPERMUD TREATMENT! Is It That BAD? One Star Reviews,2018-05-29,3101,93,,"One Star Reviews takes usually high rated products, this week the GlamGlow Supermud Clearing Treatment, and talks about the one star reviews it was given. These reviews were given most likely with the reviewer not knowing how to use the product, or not doing their due diligence before purchasing and using it. 

Hopefully going over these reviews will give future consumers a better idea of how to use them, and how to avoid adverse reactions with them. 

Enjoy, and remember, these videos are made all in good fun. No reviewers were harmed or shamed in the process, all reviewers are kept anonymous and safe.

But just remember, if you insist on posting one star reviews which clearly show you didn't have a good understanding of the item before using it, I will find you!

Sorry, not sorry!

Have fun, and remember to like, subscribe and comment if you want to see more of these!

Love you!!!!

I'm sorry guys, I know I look exhausted. It was midnight and it had been a long day, I just hopped in front of the camera and went HAM.My hair is probably a mess, my make up is certainly not fresh. 

This was an intro video to my channel, to myself. My videos going forward will be between ten and fifteen minutes, TOPS.
