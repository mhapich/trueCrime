RAW Power Self Defense utilizes Adrenal Stress Scenario Training - a method of self defense that features realistic scenarios with padded mock assailants. This fast and effective teaching method gives students a chance to practice verbal boundary setting and physical self defense skills full force and full speed to all vital targets while experiencing the adrenaline, stress and unpredictability of a real assault. 
This comprehensive method of self defense training gives tools that people can use in a worst case physical assault, but even more useful and applicable on a daily basis, it teaches tools they need to prevent and/or avoid an assault altogether.
We prepare for other types of emergencies, like practicing fire drills and learning CPR. Make sure you're prepared for the ultimate emergency - when the crisis is happening to YOU!

287,The Dark Side of The Royal Family: King Edward VIII,2021-04-23,927730,18428,1649,"On this episode of The Dark Side we look into the life of King Edward VIII, uncle to Queen Elizabeth II, and how his actions during his short reign nearly destroyed the reputation of the Crown. His scandalous love affair that led to his swift abdication was only topped by his secret allegiance to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party during World War II. What led Britain’s most romantic monarch to back the world’s most ruthless dictator?
