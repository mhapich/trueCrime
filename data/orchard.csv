Special thanks to Tabitha Kent, whose blog Crime Piper can be found here: https://crimepiperblog.wordpress.com/
And she‚Äôs on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/TabbyKent

Tabitha has been thoroughly covering this case pretty much since everything went down for no money and not nearly enough thanks. There were so many details to keep track of when trying to put this together that I can confidently say without her help navigating all the raw sources and fielding dozens of questions, I would not have been able to complete the project on time. So if you enjoyed the video, it‚Äôd be great for you to visit her blog and let her know how much she‚Äôs appreciated üôÇ

Some might say her involvement demonstrates bias or something. No doubt this video is unapologetically bias, but just for what it‚Äôs worth, Tabitha was brought on to help after I felt I had formed my own opinion on the case. As I say, it was getting all the little details right and saving me hours worth of time scrounging around for answers to niggly questions where she lent her invaluable hand.

Special thanks to Sawyer and his partner Cathy who were kind enough to correspond with me about the Heaven‚Äôs Gate stuff and provide their perspective. Sawyer is an original HG member (or close enough to it). Class was in session a bit before Cathy‚Äôs time, so she was never a part of all of it in person, but came to be a strong believer from looking at their online materials. They have a channel where they discuss their beliefs and comment on HG tapes which you can check out here: https://www.youtube.com/c/3spmSwy

If you do go and say hi, make sure to BE NICE! They may look at the world very, very differently but they took the time to answer questions and explain their beliefs as best they could, even though they knew the final product wasn't going to be pro HG. I really appreciate them for that, and it'd be great if you let them know you do too. 

Special thanks also to Leo Helmar who‚Äôs very well read on NXIVM and Scientology and was kind enough to review the script for me. Leo has a channel that has been quiet for a while, but he plans on doing video essays on high control groups in the near future so chuck him a sub if you‚Äôre into this sort of subject: https://youtube.com/channel/UCOkvzmUIPfQYcOTawWL_M2Q",Jun,Matt Orchard - Crime and Society

Cameo Credit [Tiny Spoiler]:

You‚Äôll notice a couple of different voices pop up around the 43 min mark.

The reporter is In Human Form. IHF is a great video essayist who has made some JCS-esque interrogation breakdowns everyone is bound to enjoy. For those of you that are also into politics/philosophy, he has branched out into Adam Curtis influenced documentaries. Really high end production and I think his channel is a real hidden gem on this platform. Check him out here: https://www.youtube.com/c/Inhumanform/videos

The Governor is Scribe Light. Scribe does all kinds of stuff and is probably best known for making fun of TedX Talks.

Explanation for the 16 years thing (SPOILERS):

There isn‚Äôt much of one really. New Zealand‚Äôs justice system has less of an emphasis on punishment than other countries, and we don‚Äôt do consecutive sentences - so you don‚Äôt see those Holtzclaw-esque centuries long prison terms. Bain was relatively young, had no prior history and 16 years is actually getting up there in terms of what you see handed down for serious crimes - this was especially so at the time.

[MORE SPOILERS, don't keep going if you haven't finished the video]

One thing to bear in mind before getting TOO outraged at how lax we are: A minimum non-parole period is just that, a minimum. So once his 16 years were up, if he was still deemed a danger he could be kept inside, and there is no maximum as to how long they could extend his prison stay. Though in Bain‚Äôs case he likely would have gotten out around the time his term was up due to how controversial the case was. Lifers who get parole are also on probation til the day they die...Cold comfort for anyone who might be victimized by them if they re-offend, of course.

Life without parole is not something that is categorically off the table in any circumstance. We have handed that down ONCE and it was very recently. The Christchurch Mosque Shooter will never see the light of day again. Harshest sentence ever before that was 30 years.If you‚Äôre of the opinion cold blooded murderers should be given life without parole basically by default, there are plenty of Kiwis who agree with you.",Jun,Matt Orchard - Crime and Society
