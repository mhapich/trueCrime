0,The Sickening Case of Zara Aleena,2023-05-06,17890,1392,175,"On a warm summer night last year, a predator was stalking the bustling streets of London, hunting for a victim. CCTV captured his movements, as he staggered in pursuit of lone women... they hid, took refuge in public places, or simply tried to outrun him. But his hell-bent determination meant that sadly, not all were able to escape...

1,This 1km Trail of Blood Led to a Brutal Crime Scene | The Kovan Killer,2023-03-27,193417,5410,447,"On a hot and humid summer afternoon in Singapore, a man's belt had somehow become attached to the bottom of a moving car. He was dragged face down along the rough asphalt of a major road in front of horrified onlookers, before becoming dislodged outside a busy rail station.

But a closer inspection of the man revealed there was more to this story than a tragic accident. And he'd left behind a vital clue - a bloody trail for police to follow. 

Stretching for over a kilometre through the busy streets of Kovan, it led to a second brutal crime scene, a 54-hour-manhunt, and an unexpected culprit.

2,The Strange Case of The Wycherleys,2023-02-18,66905,3652,331,"Today's story begins at the end: St. Pancras Station in London, and the arrest of mild-mannered Susan Edwards and her history buff husband, Christopher. The charge? Double murder. The victims? Susan's elderly parents.

It followed a startling phone call weeks earlier that set the ball rolling on one of the more bizarre murder investigations the UK has ever seen, when the caller pointed police to a small house in the quiet market town of Mansfield.

There, they were told, they would find the long-since decomposed remains of Patricia and William Wycherley, who'd been killed and buried in the garden of their own home some 15 years prior.

Was this call a hoax? Some... cruel joke? After all, there was one major flaw: according to their relatives and all official records, Susan's parents were both still very much alive and well, enjoying their retirement in the clean air of rural Ireland.

When police received a chilling 911 call from a desperate woman's smart watch, all they could do was listen to her muffled cries for help. But vital clues would eventually lead them to a quiet suburb in Washington.

But... they missed her by seconds. By the time they arrived, she was already on her way to a nearby forest, where she would be thrown into a shallow grave... bound, blindfolded and buried alive.

4,Murder at the Mall | Michelle Martinko,2022-12-03,90976,4157,388,"Michelle Martinko had it all. The beauty, the brains and a bright future. But all of this was snatched from her on one frigid December evening. 

This was a case so brutal and unexpected that it changed an entire community. But who did it, and why?

These questions, detectives wrestled with for many years, as her case grew ice cold. But forensic advancements and some creative thinking would eventually point police towards her killer - and Michelle's own actions on that cold December evening were crucial in helping them to finally crack her case.

6,The Murder of Pamela Lawrence,2022-10-10,71610,3523,411,"On the 23rd of May 1994, a freak storm rolled into Perth. Accompanied by heavy thunder and sharp forks of lightning, the 90mph winds wreaked havoc on the city. At 6.15pm, Peter Lawrence was growing concerned about his wife... she was late home from work. After failed attempts to call her, he made his way down to her jewellery shop, where he was met with a harrowing sight - his wife, lying in a pool of blood, clinging on to life.

But who really killed Pamela Lawrence?

8,The 100 Million Dollar Diamond Heist,2022-08-18,16212,1479,236,"On the morning of February 16th, 2003, The Diamond Squad, the world's only specialized diamond police, arrived at what was undoubtedly one of the most secure vaults on Earth. They made a call to Securilink, the vault's alarm company, and asked for the status of the alarm. ""Fully functional,"" was the reply. ""The vault is secure.""

But they could see with their own eyes that this wasn't the case. The foot-thick, three-tonne steel door was wide open and undamaged. They stepped inside the subterranean vault and found themselves knee deep in cash boxes, bags and jewellery cases. The floor was a sea of treasures of unfathomable value. Diamonds, rubies and emeralds of every conceivable cut and clarity littered the tiled floor. There were priceless artefacts and heirlooms, thick wads of cash, Rolex watches and solid gold bricks. If this was the leftover loot the thieves were unable to carry, it was clear that this was a heist of impressive scale. In fact, an estimated $100m dollars worth of jewels had been taken, in what turned out to be the largest diamond heist in history. And all done with stealth and intelligence. No alarms were triggered and no-one was hurt. It was a clandestine robbery in the dead of night.

The Antwerp Diamond Heist.

14,The Kauhajoki School Shooting,2022-06-22,28800,2106,144,"Less than a year after the worst mass shooting in Finnish peacetime history, when Pekka-Eric Auvinen left 8 Jokela Highschool students dead, the country was rocked by an even deadlier attack.

It was a cool autumn morning in 2008, and the start of a new year at a college in the quiet town of Kauhajoki in Western Finland. But it wouldn't stay quiet... because one of its students, Matti Juhani Saari, was about to walk in, shrouded in rage, and armed with a semi-automatic pistol.

(NOTE: The Virginia Tech shooting actually resulted in 32 deaths, plus the shooter. Sorry for any confusion.)

And the extraordinary lengths he would go to in order to evade capture are the stuff of nightmares.
