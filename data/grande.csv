1261,Kitty Genovese Murder Case Analysis & The Bystander Effect,2020-08-19,39123,2902,539,"This video answers the questions: Can I analyze the Kitty Genovese murder and the bystander effect? This murder case is one of the most well-known in the world of counselor education and related fields like social work and psychology because it is said to illustrate what is referred to as the “bystander effect.” This is the idea that when a crime is witnessed by multiple people, the probability that one or more will intervene is lower than if there was just a single witness. This case also contributed significantly to the establishment of the national emergency number in United States: 911.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

Narcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. It has nine symptom criteria, five of which are required for a diagnosis.

2: Fantasies 
3: Special or unique
4: Requires excessive admiration

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

Narcissism is characterized by a strong sense of entitlement and grandiosity, a high need for power, and an arrogant and condescending attitude

Psychopathy: This trait is often viewed as the darkest of the dark triad. It’s characterized by a lack of empathy, guilt, or remorse, recklessness, deceptiveness, fearlessness, and a manipulative interpersonal style.

Dr. Rosenthal is a virologist and an immunology professor. Dr. Rosenthal answers several questions related to the novel coronarvirus:
1. Can you discuss the process of developing a vaccine? How long will it take? Does the process take a certain amount of time no matter how many people are working on the development? Is the development linear or trial and error?
2. Do ethical considerations slow the process down?
3. Would development accelerate if more financial resources were committed?
4. Once a vaccine has been developed, is it easy to produce substantial quantities of it?
5. Is developing a cure possible? Is the process similar to one used to find a vaccine?
6. What is the mechanism of death with Covid 19?
7. Why are some people asymptomatic while others die from the infection?
8. Will this virus become seasonal (like influenza)?
9. Without a vaccine, it is realistic to believe they can safely socialize with the population or do they need to stay isolated?
10. Can social distancing contain the virus or are we simply delaying the inevitable
11. What percentage of the population needs to be immune to realize “herd immunity?”

1398,What are Misidentification Delusions? | Why do people see strangers in the mirror?,2020-04-07,17111,896,270,"This video answers the questions: Can I talk about delusions of misidentification?

I’ll go through several delusions including Mirrored-Self Misidentificaiton, Fregoli Delusion, Intermetamorphosis, Cotard Delusion, Capgras Delusion, Reduplicative Paramnesia, Subjective Doubles, Lycanthropy, Phantom Boarder Delusion, and Sex Change Delusion

A delusion is a fixed false belief that is resistant to counterevidence.
They are associated with a number of mental disorders including schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and major mood disorders. Delusions not only have a strong association to disorders related to mental health but also to disorders of physical health like brain tumors, dementia, vascular diseases, and infectious diseases.

One particularly rare type of delusion is a delusion of misidentification. These delusions are most frequently associated with schizophrenia and dementia.

A delusion of misidentification is when the delusion involves an incorrect belief about the identity of other people, oneself, animals, objects, or places.
In theory, misidentification delusions share two common elements:
1. a misidentified entity
2. an incorrect belief about the identity of that entity

Hoarding disorder was first introduced as an official mental disorder in 2013 with the publication of DSM 5, before that the symptoms of hoarding recognized, but was thought to a possible expression of OCD or related to psychosis, in some cases perhaps OCPD (one of the symptom criteria for OCPD is the inability to throw out worthless items)

The criteria for hoarding disorder:
A. persistent difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of value
B. the difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding
C. the difficulty results in the accumulation of possessions that causes congestion in living areas
D. clinically significant distress
E. not attributable to a medical condition
F. not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g. OCD, MDD, or schizophrenia)

More detailed breakdown of DID, The Dissociative Identity Disorder Controversy (Trauma vs. Iatrogenic): https://youtu.be/zqTP0CP9aDk

Dissociative identity disorder is an official mental disorder in the DSM and the criteria for DID are listed there. We see a disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states (in some cultures these distinct personality states may be referred to as possession), we see a marked discontinuity of self and alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and sensory motor functions. These different personality states may be observed by other individuals and reported to the individual who has this disorder. We also see recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, personal information, or traumatic events. These gaps in recall can't be attributed to normal forgetfulness. There must be clinically significant distress or impairment and it cannot be a normal part of cultural or religious practices, substance use, or a medical condition. The prevalence of dissociative identity disorder is thought to be between 1 and 1.6% of the general population. We know that this particular disorder is associated with a great deal of comorbidity, meaning it tends to co-occur with other mental disorders like borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, sleep disorders, conversion disorder, and substance use disorder. Also, self-harm behaviors and suicidal behaviors have been associated with dissociative identity disorder.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional.

Support Dr. Grande on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/drgrande



A typical case studies involves a counselor, or other psychotherapist, who wants to present information from one of their cases. For example, they may want to report the client’s history, psychopathology, and response to treatment. This report is completed with the clients consent and details are changed to protect the client’s identity.
The case study I review in this video is a bit different. This case report was written by a psychotherapist and it discusses the experiences she had with one of her clients, who was also a psychotherapist.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

Narcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. It has nine symptom criteria, five of which are required for a diagnosis.

1: Grandiose sense of self-importance 
2: Fantasies 
3: Special or unique
4: Requires excessive admiration

4: Aggressiveness, physical fights

Many have argued that ASPD is technically the most socially destructive personality disorder, mostly because of its relationship to violence and crime. It’s also the costliest financially, in part because the cost to incarcerate criminal offenders, although one can certainly make the argument that NPD can be more costly because of the mismanagement of resources associated with that disorder.

Some researchers believe that attachment theory may be able to partially explain the development of anxiety, depression, personality disorders, as well as other factors like marital problems, poor academic performance, and other negative outcomes. Attachment styles may be a major determining factor in the organization of personality and etiological for psychopathology.

Attachment model from Bartholomew and Horowitz: 
1. secure attachment: this is considered healthy attachment, we see a capacity maintain close relationships without losing a sense of autonomy, placing value on intimate friendships, and being thoughtful when discussing relationships
2. dismissing attachment: with this style we see someone who has restricted emotions, flat affect, they downplay the importance of close relationships, they place a strong emphasis on being self-reliant and independent, and they are not clear and trustworthy when they discuss relationships
3. preoccupied attachment: here we see someone who needs other people to accept them, they have a tendency to idealize others, they are overinvolved in close relationships, and we see exaggerated emotionality and incoherence when discussing relationships
4. fearful attachment: here we see someone who avoids close relationships because they are afraid of rejection, they tend to distrust other people and they feel insecure

Circadian preference is also called chronotype. Most research indicates there are two chronotypes: morningness and eveningness.

The word “circadian” is refers to the near 24-hour physiological rhythm that has been observed at every system level in nearly all plants and animals.

It’s controlled by internal factors like the self-sustaining oscillator mechanism as well as external factors like temperature, physical activity, social relationships, light, and food consumption.

If an individual has morningness, they get up easily in the morning, they are more alert in the morning as compared to the evening, and they tend to have a preference for morning activities. Sometimes morning people are referred to as larks.

If somebody has eveningness, they tend to be more alert in the evening, they are able to sleep late into the morning, and they prefer afternoon and evening activities. Sometimes evening people are referred to as owls.

1462,Case Study: Narcissism and Snapping | When the Narcissist Loses Control,2020-01-26,431347,13990,2144,"This video answers the question: Can I analyze a case study featuring a narcissist who snapped? Sometimes snapping is referred to as an episode of narcissistic rage. 

What does it mean to snap? There is no official scientific definition, but for the purposes this video, here is the definition: when somebody suddenly manifests aggression that is different from their normal behavior.

People can snap for a variety of reasons. The cause of snapping comes down to a combination of stress and personality.

Narcissists are susceptible due to their personality structure and they are also susceptible because they create stress through their behavior.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

TRIN-r -True Response Inconsistency 
F-r -       Infrequent Responses 
Fp-r -     Infrequent Psychopathology Responses

Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

1479,Does Color Preference Really Predict Extraversion? | Who is Destined to be Extraverted?,2020-01-05,13215,877,204,"This video answers the questions: Is there any way to predict extraversion? Does color preference really predict extraversion?

High extraversion is usually considered socially desirable, although certainly has its drawbacks, just like any score on any of the big five personality traits. There is no perfect personality and there is no ideal level of a single personality trait.

On the positive side of extraversion, we see his associated with happiness, success in social environments, being promoted at work, and a number of other positive outcomes.

On the negative side, extraversion is associated with grandiose narcissism, talkativeness, substance use, and risk-taking.

The six facets of extraversion:

Warmth: friendly, kind
Gregariousness: talkative, spontaneous, outgoing
Assertiveness: confident, enthusiastic, aggressive, dominating
Activity: energetic, always want to be busy, in a hurry 
Excitement-seeking: adventurous, courageous, bold
positive emotions: optimistic, cheerful, happy

1480,"Conspiracy Theories, Schizotypy, & Dark Triad Traits | What is a Conspiracist?",2020-01-04,26939,1232,565,"This video answers the questions: What is a conspiracist? Is there a relationship between belief in conspiracy theories, the Dark Triad Traits, and schizotypy?

There is no single agreed-upon definition for a conspiracy belief, which makes studying the phenomenon somewhat difficult. Here are two definitions that appear in the research?

1. The unnecessary assumption of conspiracy when other explanations are more probable.

2. An unverified and relatively implausible allegation of conspiracy, claiming that significant events are the result of a secret plot carried out by a preternaturally sinister and powerful group of people.

Over 50% of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory.

The belief is not one ordinarily accepted by other members of the person’s culture or subculture.

1485,Good Will Hunting | Analysis of Counseling Scenes,2019-12-28,41433,1863,393,"This video answers the questions: Can I discuss and analyze the counseling scenes from the 1997 movie “Good Will Hunting?” What are my thoughts on the movie overall?

Good Will Hunting is a 1997 movie involving a janitor, Will Hunting, who has incredible mathematical talent. This character is played by Matt Damon. We also see a therapist, specifically a psychologist, named Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams. Will is treated several times throughout the movie by Sean, and their relationship is often considered to be the most redeeming and interesting part of the film.

Some people believe that this movie really captures the essence of counseling. Some believe it’s one of the worst things that could have happened to counseling. Others believe that even with the ethical problems we see in Sean’s behavior, much can be learned from the therapy scenes in this film.

1486,6 Ways Introversion is better than Extraversion | The Upside of Low Extraversion,2019-12-26,111538,4886,740,"This video answers the questions: Are there ways that low extraversion is better than high extraversion? (Is there an upside to being an introvert as opposed to being an extrovert?) 

One of the things we hear about extraversion all the time is how it’s more socially desirable. Research supports this general concept, that all things being equal, high extraversion imparts advantages at a social level. However, just because extraversion is more socially desirable doesn’t mean it’s more desirable in every way. 

I cover the six ways being an introvert is better and align these ways with the six facets of extraversion.

The six facets of extraversion:

1. Warmth: friendly, kind
2. Gregariousness: talkative, spontaneous, outgoing
3. Assertiveness: confident, enthusiastic, aggressive, dominating
4. Activity: energetic, always want to be busy, in a hurry 
5. Excitement-seeking: adventurous, courageous, bold
6. Positive Emotions: optimistic, cheerful, happy

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

1493,Do Introverts Really Get Tired from Socializing? | Extraversion & Mental Depletion,2019-12-13,236922,8663,2229,"This video answers the questions: Do introverts really get tired from socializing? What is the relationship between extraversion and mental depletion?

The five-factor model of personality (FFM)

This model of personality features five big traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of these big five traits can be broken down further into six facets, for a total of 30 facets.

Someone high in openness to experience appreciates art, likes abstract thinking, theories
intellectually curious, imaginative, creative, adventurous, and tends to fantasize.

Conscientiousness is characterized by being reliable, hard-working and productive, consistent, steady, organized, and decisive.

Those high in extraversion are comfortable in crowds, assertive, friendly, outgoing, disinhibited,
talkative, and have positive emotions.

Agreeableness is characterized by trust, modesty, being gentle and kind, having a lot of empathy,
following the rules, and being straightforward.

Neuroticism is characterized by emotional lability (emotionally unstable), insecurity, being angry, depressed, anxious, hostile, and being impulsive (in the sense of not being able to resist temptation).

1497,Case Study: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) | Unusual Treatment Strategy,2019-12-06,33281,1323,187,"This video answers the question: Can I review a case study involving an unusual treatment strategy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?

OCD is disorder that features both obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are thoughts of fear or anxiety that push people to engage in rituals. When somebody does this, they are engaging in a compulsion. Some people with OCD only have obsessions. Sometimes this is called purely obsessional OCD or “pure o.” OCD is often comorbid with Major Depressive Disorder and depression in general.

Even though insight may be compromised with OCD, the majority of people with OCD realize that the obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors are not logical and are extreme in nature. This awareness and insight can be helpful, but it often doesn’t allow them to control the symptoms.

OCD has real consequences:
- As many as 60% of those with OCD have depressive symptoms.
- 40% or underemployed or unemployed
- 60% don’t achieve what they want academically due to the symptoms of OCD
- 70% have reported difficulties with family relationships

1499,The Mandalorian Personality Profile | Five-Factor Model,2019-12-03,13857,718,104,"This video answers the question: Can I analyze the mental health and personality characteristics of The Mandalorian?

The five-factor model of personality (FFM):

This model of personality features five big traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of these big five traits can be broken down further into six facets, for a total of 30 facets.

Someone high in openness to experience appreciates art, likes abstract thinking, theories, is intellectually curious, imaginative, creative, adventurous, and tends to fantasize.

Conscientiousness is characterized by being reliable, hard-working and productive, consistent, steady, organized, and decisive.

Those high in extraversion are comfortable in crowds, assertive, friendly, outgoing, disinhibited,
talkative, and have positive emotions.

Agreeableness is characterized by trust, modesty, being gentle and kind, having a lot of empathy,
following the rules, and being straightforward.

Neuroticism is characterized by emotional lability (emotionally unstable), insecurity, being angry, depressed, anxious, hostile, and being impulsive (in the sense of not being able to resist temptation).

1502,Doomsday Preppers: Mental Health and Personality,2019-11-29,41597,1978,817,"This video answers the questions: What are Preppers (Doomsday Preppers, Disaster Preppers)? Concerns about the end of the world have been featured in the media for many years (e.g. The Walking Dead, I am legend, World War Z, Armageddon, Deep Impact, The Day After Tomorrow, Oblivion, Zombieland, The Postman, and Mad Max). Many themes have emerged including survival, resisting evil, adaptation, and rebuilding society. Some of those concerned with these themes have started preparing for a collapse of society. I examine possible personality and mental health characteristics associated with these behaviors.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

Psychopathy:

There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.

1513,What is Hoarding Disorder? | Is it different than OCD and Autism?,2019-11-11,85107,3865,616,"This video answers the questions: What is Hoarding Disorder? How can Hoarding Disorder be differentiated from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?

Hoarding Disorder Criteria from DSM-5:

A: persistent difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of value 
B: the difficulty we see with criterion A is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding those items 
C: the difficulty results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use. If living areas are uncluttered it’s only because of third-party intervention, like family members
D: clinically significant distress 
E: not attributable to a medical condition like a brain injury
F: not explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder like OCD, MDD, schizophrenia, or autism 
specifiers: with excessive acquisition, with good or fair insight, with poor insight, with absent insight/delusional beliefs

This model of personality features five big traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of these big five traits can be broken down further into six facets, for a total of 30 facets.

Someone high in openness to experience appreciates art, likes abstract thinking, theories
intellectually curious, imaginative, creative, adventurous, and tends to fantasize.

This presentation reviewed here discusses some of the challenges with treating BPD in a college counseling center setting.

Borderline Personality Disorder:

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), we see nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder and five have to be met for a diagnosis. The symptom criteria include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in two areas that are potentially self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder, so it’s in the same cluster is antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders.

1568,Case Study: Dissociative Identity Disorder | Differentiating from Malingering,2019-08-12,129714,3607,620,"This video answers the questions: Can I review a case study related to Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)? How can counselors differentiate Dissociative Identity Disorder from malingering?

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is an official mental disorder in the DSM and the criteria for DID are listed there. We see a disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states (in some cultures these distinct personality states may be referred to as possession), we see a marked discontinuity of self and alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and sensory motor functions. These different personality states may be observed by other individuals and reported to the individual who has this disorder. We also see recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, personal information, or traumatic events. These gaps in recall can't be attributed to normal forgetfulness. There must be clinically significant distress or impairment and it cannot be a normal part of cultural or religious practices, substance use, or a medical condition. The prevalence of dissociative identity disorder is thought to be between 1 and 1.6% of the general population. DID is associated with a great deal of comorbidity, meaning it tends to co-occur with other mental disorders like borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, sleep disorders, conversion disorder, and substance use disorder. Also, self-harm behaviors and suicidal behaviors have been associated with dissociative identity disorder.

1576,5 Reasons Why You Still Love the Narcissist,2019-07-30,133375,5112,776,"This video answers the question: Why do people still love a narcissist after the relationship is over? A narcissistic romantic relationship is associated with a certain degree of manipulation, less than kind treatment, a fair amount of stress, and sometimes feelings of depression and anxiety. There can be a lot of other problems associated with these relationships as well. At the very least they are an unpleasant experience and at the worst - unimaginably horrible. Even with all this, when a relationship is over a lot of people find themselves not only missing the narcissist but also still loving a narcissist. Considering all the negative events that happen during the course of the relationship, it's understandable that this feeling of love or missing somebody can come as a surprise to someone.

1609,Nine Signs of Narcissism Exposure,2019-06-19,173631,6951,982,"This video answers the question: What are the signs of narcissism exposure? These signs can occur when someone is exposed to a narcissist in a romantic relationship, a work setting, or a variety of other social settings. I will cover nine signs of narcissism exposure. 

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande

How do the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) and INCEL (involuntarily celibate or involuntary celibate) philosophies connect with sexual economics theory? Which theory has more empirical support? The factors and dynamics of sexuality have been explained by many different models including a biological and a political model. The political model, known as social construction, is often referenced by the feminist theory of sexuality. A third way to conceptualize sexuality would be through an economics model, which is sometimes referred to as social exchange theory or sexual economics theory. A related construct is called sexual market value, which is simply a value determined when operating under sexual economics theory.

These two terms are often confused with one another, because narcissistic abuse is a type of emotional abuse. Emotional abuse lacks the physical parameters of physical abuse and is not as well understood, and therefore it is harder to define, detect, and treat. Narcissistic abuse is a special type of emotional abuse that comes with its own clinical challenges. Both emotional abuse and narcissistic abuse can lead to anxiety and depression.

Jeffrey Dahmer was one of the most notorious serial killers in the history of the United States. He murdered 17 people from 1978 to 1991, was arrested, sentenced to prison, and while in prison was murdered by another inmate. During the hearings to determine if Jeffrey Dahmer met the legal definition for insanity, mental health professionals speculated that he had a number of disorders including: borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, psychotic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, and others diagnoses. Later there was speculation that he may have schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which is known today as schizoaffective disorder.

1613,Why Narcissists Win the War of Attrition | Discovering a Narcissist may not matter,2019-06-14,48536,2314,424,"This video answers the question: Why is it when one discovers they are in a relationship with a narcissist, the narcissistic manipulation tactics are still effective? Many find that discovering that someone is a narcissist doesn’t contribute to the end of narcissistic abuse as much as one would expect. Although understanding that someone is narcissistic does impart an advantage in recovery, it’s also important to be aware of the narcissistic war of attrition. Narcissists have a resilience advantage when it comes to enduring hostile environments, due to their low neuroticism and resistance to criticism.

Incel stands for involuntarily celibate or involuntary celibate. It refers to an ideology and an online community. The involuntarily celibate tend to believe that only attractive men are able to have sex with attractive women, which leaves the involuntarily celibate unable to develop sexual relationships with women. Although most people who identify as Incels are not dangerous, there have been a few violent incidents involving people in this community:

- May 23, 2014: Isla vista California, a man named Elliott Roger killed six people and injured 14 others before killing himself
 
- October 1, 2015: Roseburg, Oregon, a man named Chris Harper-Mercer kills nine people and injures eight others before killing himself

We see research which further indicates that married individuals enjoy certain benefits over those who are unmarried. For example, better mental and physical health, increased happiness, and better economic position. A more detailed look into literature reveals conflicting findings around the association between marriage and happiness. We see a community of men (including the “Men Going Their Own Way” [MGTOW] community) and women who have decided marriage is not a good deal from a cost-benefit perspective. The relationship between marriage and happiness is actually quite complex and it underscores the importance of understand difference between correlation and causation.

1632,Narcissism in Mother-in-law/Daughter-in-law relationships,2019-05-20,120415,3552,1091,"This video answers the question: Can I describe the narcissistic mother-in-law in the context of a mother-in-law daughter-in-law relationship ? This type of relationship can be challenging.
We see in the research literature, from the perspective of the daughter-in-law, that this relationship causes a lot of tension and they find that the communication is often hurtful, dissatisfying, and the poor quality of these mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationships can cause damage in marriages. There are a lot of factors to consider here in terms of the ramifications of the narcissistic mother-in-law, like the potential relational and mental health ramifications.
Narcissism is a number of characteristics associated with it: manipulation, arrogance, being condescending, a sense of being superior, a sense of entitlement, self-centeredness, requiring a lot of admiration, being resentful, distrusting, feeling insecure, and also being cold, distant and unforgiving. Now on top of this, we see a lot of anger, aggression, and jealousy as well. Narcissism can be divided into two types: grandiose and vulnerable. I think of vulnerable narcissism as more related to the problems with the mother-in-law/ daughter-in-law dynamic, but grandiose narcissism can play a part as well.

The crime in the case was a triple murder of three 8-year-old boys: Stevie Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore.
The West Memphis Three were released after an “alford plea” in 2011, so they are technically guilty, but they are allowed to assert their innocence.

1638,How to Unlock Your Inner Narcissist | Coping with Criticism,2019-05-10,55910,2224,262,"This video answers questions: Can I offer tips on how to handle criticism? How can one cope with criticism? I've also seen requests on how to ignore insults and how to separate insults from criticism and a few times even heard questions that ask are there ways to ignore criticism or to ignore negative criticism altogether.

What we see on the Internet in terms of dealing with criticism is some good advice, but also a lot of awful advice. For example, if we look at the area of narcissism, we see this idea that anyone who criticizes anyone else must be a narcissist. Under this faulty logic, if somebody's a narcissist, we should learn to ignore them, which of course is not good advice, because that's actually narcissistic in itself. 

The construct of “unlocking your inner narcissist” (we see this advice offered by the life coaches and other people on the Internet) is not always useful. I think there is a better way (more logical) to handle criticism.",May,Dr. Todd Grande

I'll take a look at the science and then I'll talk about what I've learned from my clinical experience as a mental health counselor. We see with attraction there are a number of theories out there: socially desirable traits predict attraction, traits that are readily perceived predict attraction, similarity predicts attraction (likes attract), and opposites attract. Another theory is that sex is a moderator of romantic interest. This theory states that romantic attraction is different for males as opposed to females.

The term Stockholm Syndrome is theorized as related to other in some way like “identification with the aggressor,” “trauma bonding,” “battered women's syndrome” and “learned helplessness.” This gets into a controversial area because Stockholm Syndrome has been expanded into a lot of these other areas, so we see a parallel between hostage taking and intimate partner violence and other situations similar to that. Where did we get the term “Stockholm Syndrome?” In 1973, there was a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden where the bank employees who were held hostage during the robbery bonded with and eventually defended their captors. There have been many other examples of this phenomenon. In the United States in 1974, we see a famous case with an heiress named Patty Hearst. She was kidnapped by a violent left-wing group and eventually she joined them and committed crimes along with them. More recently, we see the case Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped and had opportunities to escape but didn't take them.

When we hear the term “denial” we often hear it in the context of substance use disorders (e.g. if somebody is drinking alcohol excessively, but they deny they have any type of problem. Denial is really one of the most powerful and potentially destructive constructs in mental health and it could be argued that it's on a continuum with delusional behavior, but it's more situational. 

There are many theories around denial: moral defect model, interactional model, mental impairment model, psychodynamic theory of denial, and phenomenological.

Descriptive statistics behind substance use disorder:
- 5% of the population of the world has used illegal drugs and last year
- 2.5% of the worldwide population has used illegal drugs in the last month
- 76 million people could be classified as having alcohol use disorder
- Alcohol causes about 2 million deaths a year worldwide
- In the United States, almost 10% of the population has used an illegal drug in the last month
- Over 15 million Americans struggle with alcohol use disorder

I put together this video of ten signs of vulnerable narcissistic abuse. This applies to romantic relationships and with these particular ten signs, I looked at heterosexual romantic relationships not only in the scientific literature but in my clinical experience. I review the “dark cloud” theory of vulnerable narcissism.

There are two types of narcissism: grandiose and vulnerable. There are characteristics that we see across both types of narcissism that would be self-centeredness, a sense of entitlement, and a need for admiration. Specific to vulnerable narcissism, we see a low level of extraversion (somebody who has vulnerable narcissism tends to be introverted), high neuroticism, anxiety, depression, anger, resentfulness, distrustfulness, insecurity, feelings of shame, hypersensitivity to criticism, defensiveness, socially awkwardness, shyness, pessimism, being unforgiving, internalized anger, aggression, and jealousy.

1646,What Happens if a Client Confesses to Murder? | Counselor Limits of Confidentiality,2019-04-29,251472,7801,831,"This video answers the question: If a client confesses a murder to a counselor, does the counselor have to report it? I've heard a number of variants of this question as well, so not just murder, but other serious crimes like assault kidnapping, bank robbery, drug trafficking, and other crime.  Now this may seem like a rare situation, but we do know that 40% of murders remain unsolved and of course high percentages of other serious crimes are unsolved as well. Many of these offenders do continue to commit crimes, so they could be in prison for something else and not the crime that they're trying to hide. However, it is still possible and there have been counselors who have been in this situation before.

One key consideration would be the Duty to Warn / Duty to Protect as they may be applicable depending on the circumstances. This is combining the responsibilities of a mental health clinician to treat a client and help that client with this idea of protecting other people or protecting the public from the client. It gets into an area that a lot of counselors feel uncomfortable with and there are actually a lot of reasons to feel uncomfortable with it, because the law the duty to warn law or the duty to protect law is different in each state.
When we talk about the Tarasoff case, we're really actually talking about two cases: there was a Tarasoff ruling in 1974 that provided this duty to warn (Tarasoff I), and Tarasoff II in 1976, which changed the duty to warn over to a duty to protect. The key finding in these cases was that the protective privilege of therapy ends where public peril begins.

Was Nicholas Godejohn‘s sentence fair? What role did Nicholas Godejohn‘s Autism Spectrum Disorder status play in diminished capacity?

In 2016, Gypsy Rose Blanchard was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2015 murder of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. In 2018, Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s conspirator, Nicholas Godejohn, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The case has attracted attention because it has been alleged that Dee Dee Blanchard had symptoms of Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy and abused Gypsy Rose Blanchard for years.

Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy is a rare disorder where a perpetrator, usually the parent or other caregiver, intentionally induces, falsifies, or exaggerates manifestations of
 physical or mental health symptoms in another person under his/her care. No obvious external incentives (e.g., financial gain) are involved.

There is no universally agreed-upon definition of a sexual homicide, but most experts seem to agree that evidence of sexual activity at the crime scene by the perpetrator is required for an offense to qualify as a sexual homicide. This evidence could occur before the killing, after the killing, or throughout the event.

1649,"Treating ""Borderline Woman - Psychopathic Man"" Couples | Clinical Challenges",2019-04-26,36899,1499,290,"This video answers the question: Can I describe a romantic relationship type where an individual with borderline personality disorder is with an individual who has antisocial personality or psychopathy? I've also heard this question asked where one person had narcissism. For this video, I'm really going to focus on borderline personality disorder on one side and psychopathy on the other side, because psychopathy really covers a lot of these other characteristics we see with antisocial personality disorder and that we would see with narcissistic personality disorder.

Borderline Personality Disorder.

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), we see nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder and five have to be met for a diagnosis. The symptom criteria include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in two areas that are potentially self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation.

Psychopathy:

There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

When we look at posttraumatic stress disorder, we see that in the qualifying trauma section there are four types of traumatic experiences listed: directly experiencing a traumatic event, witnessing a traumatic event in person occurring to others, learning about a traumatic event that occurs to a family member or close friend, or repeated exposure to aversive details of a traumatic event. 

The four other categories of symptom criteria for PTSD include: intrusion (e.g. intrusive memories or flashbacks), avoidance (e.g. avoids thoughts or reminders of the trauma), negative mood (e.g. anger and guilt), and arousal (e.g. hypervigilance and difficulty sleeping). These symptoms have to be present for more than a month and they have to cause clinically significant distress.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande

I've heard this worded many different ways including: Why are some women attracted to bad boys? I've talked about this before in a collaboration video. I'm going be looking specifically at the psychopathy component and honing in on the subclinical psychopathy component. A lot of the time when we think about subclinical psychopathy, we think about the dark triad: psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. I discuss Jordan Peterson’s interpretation of “A Billion Wicked Thoughts.”

Psychopathy:

There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.

1653,"Are Internet Trolls Psychopathic? | Sadistic, Narcissistic & Antisocial Personality",2019-04-22,42937,2307,780,"This video answers the question: Can I describe the typical personality profile of the internet troll? This would be the typical profile and any particular person who engages in internet trolling behavior wouldn't necessarily have the different characteristics I'm going to describe in this video. What is internet trolling? It is a deliberate attempt to create conflict and distress by communicating inflammatory, provocative, and menacing comments to victims. An Internet troll is someone who is generally recognized as being antisocial and malicious. 

Psychopathy and sadism both predict internet trolling behavior. Internet trolling is associated with primary, but not secondary psychopathy. Primary psychopathy is characterized by traits like being callous, manipulative, being a pathological liar, lacking in remorse, empathy, and guilt.
With secondary psychopathy we see somebody who's impulsive, irresponsible, neurotic, emotionally reactive, they tend to engage in criminal behaviors, and they are sensation-seeking.
With psychopathy, cognitive empathy again is intact and affective empathy is not. Internet trolling has an association with affective empathy and cognitive empathy. As cognitive empathy increases, we see an increase in internet trolling behavior, but only when psychopathy increases as well. 

Internet trolling has an association with both direct sadism and vicarious sadism. Direct sadism is when somebody enjoys directly hurting or humiliating other people and vicarious sadism is when the enjoyment is derived from watching other people being hurt or humiliated.

Grandiose narcissism has a positive association with Internet trolling, but vulnerable narcissism does not have an association.

Grandiose narcissism is characterized by arrogance, being socially bold, having high self- confidence, having superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, callous/unemotional traits, optimism, externalized anger, and high extraversion

1655,Tarasoff Murder Case | Duty to Warn vs. Duty to Protect,2019-04-20,102389,3145,247,"This video answers the question: What is the duty to warn (or duty to protect)? When I say duty to warn, I'm talking about the obligation in most jurisdictions that mental health professionals have if they're treating a client and that client makes a threat to another person or they have some reason to believe that client is going to harm another person. When we think about the duty to warn we think about a particular legal case: Tarasoff versus the Regents of the University of California. This case forever changed mental health treatment confidentiality. 

This is really the dangerous intersection between mental health and the law. This is combining the responsibilities of a mental health clinician to treat a client and help that client with this idea of protecting other people or protecting the public from the client. It gets into an area that a lot of counselors feel uncomfortable with and there are actually a lot of reasons to feel uncomfortable with it, because the law the duty to warn law or the duty to protect law is different in each state.
When we talk about the Tarasoff case, we're really actually talking about two cases: there was a Tarasoff ruling in 1974 that provided this duty to warn (Tarasoff I), and Tarasoff II in 1976, which changed the duty to warn over to a duty to protect. The key finding in these cases was that the protective privilege of therapy ends where public peril begins.

Was her sentence fair? Should she be released early? What was the role of Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy (Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another)? 
In 2016, Gypsy Rose Blanchard was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2015 murder of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. In 2018, Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s conspirator, Nicholas Godejohn, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The case has attracted attention because it has been alleged that Dee Dee Blanchard had symptoms of Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy and abused Gypsy Rose Blanchard for years.

Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy is a rare disorder where a perpetrator, usually the parent or other caregiver, intentionally induces, falsifies, or exaggerates manifestations of
 physical or mental health symptoms in another person under his/her care. No obvious external incentives (e.g., financial gain) are involved.

We actually have a lot of information available in the literature about familicide and yet you'll see kind of a narrowing in on this case without considering that larger context. Sometimes in research and just in trying to gain knowledge in general we have to step back from something to get a clear view of it.

The types of familicide:

Immortality
- murders committed in an attempt to immortalize the family
- perpetrator “protects” the family, believing that death is better than poverty.

need for control 
- perpetrator commits the final act of control by killing the entire family
- perpetrator views the family as a singular unit and does not differentiate between individuals,

Suicide
- perpetrator kills the spouse and children because he believes they are unable to go on
  without their head of household
- perpetrator is also driven by a desire to protect the family from the shame of having a parent commit suicide 

Revenge
- tied to sexual jealousy
- perpetrator believes the spouse or ex-spouse has been unfaithful
- children are seen equally responsible for any betrayal

1664,How to Reason with a Narcissist | Can they be Persuaded?,2019-04-07,102836,3566,600,"This video answers the question: Is there any way to persuade narcissist? I've heard other versions of the same question: Is there any way to reason with somebody who's narcissistic? Is there any way to encourage behavioral change? 
Narcissism is on a continuum. If we believe somebody is narcissistic that doesn't necessarily mean anything. We would have to know what traits they have and to what extent. The continuum extends from healthy, normal, and adaptive on one end all the way over to pathological on the other end. One of the pathologies that's associated with narcissism would be narcissistic personality disorder, but somebody wouldn't necessarily need to have that to have narcissism that's interfering in their life or to have narcissism that's making it difficult to interact with them. There are two types of narcissism: grandiose (overt) and vulnerable (covert). Grandiose narcissism is characterized by a sense of entitlement, arrogance, social dominance, and confidence. Somebody who has grandiose narcissistic features genuinely believes they are superior.
vulnerable narcissism is characterized by hypersensitivity to criticism, insecurity, anger, aggression, and a lot of shame. Somebody who has vulnerable narcissistic features doesn't fully believe that they are superior. They are trying to believe they're superior, but they don't quite buy the self-deception.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande

She was convicted in 2015 of murdering a young man named Travis Alexander, who was somebody with whom she was in a relationship. Support Dr. Grande on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/drgrande
I look at the timeline, but also the mental health and personality characteristics that may have been going on in this case. To be clear, I'm not diagnosing anybody, rather just speculating based on the evidence that's available. Jodi Arias was born in 1980 and Travis Alexander was born in 1977.  The murder occurred on June 4th 2008. In 2015, she was found guilty of first-degree murder and on sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. One of the reasons this was interesting, is this juxtaposition with post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder. There were different diagnoses from different clinicians. Whenever we see mental health and the law come together, this is a dangerous intersection.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual the DSM, which contains these mental disorders was written for treatment, it wasn't written to explain why people commit crimes.

Symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationship pattern, identity disturbance, impulsivity and at least two areas that are potentially self damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, paranoid ideation or dissociation

Symptom criteria for narcissistic personality disorder: grandiose sense of self-importance, fantasies about success wealth and power, believing oneself to be special or unique, requiring excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, exploiting other people interpersonally, lack of empathy, jealousy, arrogance

I've also had some other questions about the same construct like: What is passive-aggressive personality? What is the history was behind passive-aggressive personality disorder? Why is it no longer in the DSM? The term passive-aggressive was first used clinically speaking during World War II and it was used to describe soldiers who refused to comply with the orders of officers, but the construct of passive aggressive actually existed before that. It was really central to some of the clinical theory that we saw from that time period. Passive-aggressive behavior has been shown to undermine successful treatment. If somebody has another disorder, like a major mood disorder, passive-aggressive behavior can get in the way of that disorder being treated. The construct is important but, of course, the personality disorder is no longer in the DSM.

I found an article published in 2016 that had a sample size of over 1300 participants that was titled “On the nature of creepiness” and it is an excellent article looking at what it means to be creepy and how people form these perceptions of creepiness. First, we have to understand this concept of the creepiness detector. What does our creepiness detector really warn us about? Does it warne us about physical or social harm or something else? It doesn’t seem like it is closely related physical or social harm, but rather creepiness is about anxiety being aroused. It's the ambiguity about whether something is threatening or whether something should be feared. Tt's the ambiguity about the precise nature of a threat as well. Creepy is really different than concepts like disgusting or terrifying because with those concepts the way we should react is pretty clear.

Casey Anthony was charged with killing her two-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. This crime allegedly took place in 2008. I'll be taking a look at a lot of different factors in this case including potential mental health and personality factors, but just to be clear I'm not diagnosing Casey Anthony or anyone else involved in this case. 

In 2008, Casey Anthony was 18 years old and Caylee Anthony her daughter was 2 years old. They lived with Casey's parents, Cindy and George Anthony. From an outside observer’s point of view, this case started on July 15, 2008, when Cindy Anthony called the police and reported that her granddaughter was missing for 31 days. 

The next day charges of making a false statement to law enforcement were filed against Casey as she lied during the investigation. 
in October of 2015, she would be charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child. In December, in a wooded area near their house, Caylee's body was discovered. The trial which started in 2011. There were really two theories of the crime that kind of emerged. On the state side their theory was that Casey bought chloroform used it on Caylee and then suffocated her and on the defense side they said that it was an accidental drowning.  The prosecution rested on June 15, 2011 and 15 days later the defense rested. The jury found that Casey Anthony was not guilty of any of the homicide or homicide related charges, but rather providing false information to a law enforcement officer. So she was convicted of four counts of lying to law enforcement and sentenced to one year per count, but when taking into account how long she'd already been in jail and the good behavior time she'd earned, she was released shortly after the verdict.

The dynamics in this affair appear to be a critical factor in this case. One theory of the dynamics is that Chris Watts was introverted and insecure and Nichol Kessinger was confident, extraverted, and experienced in romantic relationships. This may have led to a power differential that unintentionally contribute to the horrific murders. I review the role that immaturity, the passionate stage of romance, and impulsivity may have had in this case.

Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

Let's take a look at the characteristics of neediness or of being dependent. I'm talking about romantic relationships here, especially about appearing needy in the early stages of these relationships.

There are a number of theories about these murders including those involving psychopathy, narcissism, rage, impulsivity, and infidelity.

The details of these murders are horrific. In 2018, Chris Watts (33 at the time) murdered his wife (Shanann Watts, 34, who was 15 weeks pregnant), and his daughters (Bella, 4 & Celeste, 3). Chris was involved in an affair at the time with Nichol Lee Kessinger (30 at the time).

Psychopathy:

There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

Stated another way: Are the fantasy-based differences between these two types of narcissism? This is an interesting question because it gets into kind of the complex relationship between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder. It also makes the argument that you can, in some sense, distinguish grandiose and vulnerable narcissism by looking at fantasies, although I don't know if that's possible. Throughout my career, I have seen a lot of differences in the fantasies.

NPD narcissistic personality disorder is a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. It's a cluster B personality disorder. The symptom criteria for that disorder include: grandiose sense of self-importance, fantasies of wealth power and success, feeling special or unique, requiring excessive admiration, sense of entitlement, tending to manipulate other people, a lack of empathy, jealously, and arrogance.

It is an interesting case because it involves parricide, which is a rare type of homicide where children kill their parents. It's also interesting because it weaves the mental health components with ethics and confidentiality into the law.

Facts of the Case:
This case goes back to 1989, when two brothers Lyle Menendez (21 at the time) and Eric Menendez (18 at the time) lived in a Beverly Hills mansion with their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez. On August 18, 1989, the brothers bought two shotguns from a sporting goods store in San Diego. Two days later, Sunday night August 20, 1989 the crime took place. Jose was seated on a couch in the family room sleeping and Kitty was laying down with her head on his lap. One of the brothers aimed the 12-gauge shotgun at Jose, fired the shotgun, and struck him in the left elbow and the right arm. The other brother walked up behind Jose and shot him in the back of the head. Because of the shooting, Kitty woke up and she tried to flee, but she was injured by shots fired by the brothers. She was not killed at that time, so the brothers went out to their car because they ran out of ammunition before they could kill their mother. They reloaded the shotguns with birdshot came back in and shot her in the head several times. After Lyle and Erik killed their parents, they shot both Jose and Kitty each in the knee. They called the police and made an effort to cover up their crimes.

In 1996, a jury returned a guilty verdict and the brothers both received two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.

1677,How to Reason with Someone Who is Delusional | Is Delusional Behavior on a Continuum?,2019-03-23,174300,6748,1299,"This video answers the question: How can someone reason with somebody who is delusional? I've heard this question a few times and different versions of this question and I think sometimes the question is really talking about delusions, but I think sometimes what people mean is: How do I reason with somebody who's not being rational? I'm going to look at different levels of delusions here, so I can really answer the different types of questions. A delusional belief is a belief that's maintained despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted to be a rational argument or reality. We also see with delusions that no matter what evidence is presented, the belief is not going to change their mind. One of the difficult parts about the question is that it may be hard to know if someone is really delusional or not. That's really the realm of mental health counselors to figure out if somebody has true delusions. 
Delusions fall on a continuum. When we talk about a true delusion or pathological delusion, it's really hard to figure this out from a brief interaction. There are alternative explanations to why somebody believes something other than them being delusional for example: somebody could be misinformed, somebody could just be illogical, or somebody could have a temporary bias based on strong emotions. 
When considering whether something's delusion or not it's important to keep in mind that the belief itself isn't necessarily really important, it's the reaction to contradictory evidence.
Pathological delusions may be observed with a number of mental disorders like schizophrenia, delusional disorder, major mood disorders (major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder), and substance use disorders. Under the mental disorder delusional disorder, we see a few types of mentioned here: erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, and somatic. We also see a specifier with this disorder called “with bizarre content.”",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

This video also specifically looks at the controversy with Donald Trump, including how some public figures and professional have attempted to diagnose him with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and other mental disorders. Ethical principles disallow the diagnosing of public figures, however, some clinicians have claimed that their duty to warn supersedes the ethical prohibitions (including the Goldwater Rule). Dr. Bandy Lee (The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump) and George Conway (Tweets about NPD and APD) have both weighed in on the discussion and their positions are analyzed here.

Diagnostic criteria for NPD:
grandiosity, fantasies of success, special or unique, requiring excessive admiration, sense of entitlement, manipulation, lack of empathy, envy, arrogance
Diagnostic criteria for APD - violating society's norms, lying, impulsivity, irritability or aggression, disregarding safety, being irresponsible, lack of remorse

Can I discuss the construct of female serial killers, specifically, as opposed to the behavior we would expect to see with male serial killers?
Can I take a look at one particular female serial killer named Nannie Doss, otherwise known as “the giggling grandma?” 

When it comes to female serial killers, I think one of the weird things here is that for a long time a lot of people didn't even believe that women were capable of serial murder. If we look at a lot of the early definitions of the term serial killer, we see that they were limited to murders that involved a sexual component, and of course, we know that female serial killers rarely involve a sexual component. There are some experts who have argued and some that currently argue that there's no such thing as a female serial killer.

We see that 98% of female serial killers are white, and they start at around age 31 to 38. They tend to kill female and male victims with about equal frequency. The average number of victims of female serial killers is about 6 and the average victim age is around 48. In terms of targeting we see that 30% of female serial killers killed both and children, 45% killed only adults, and 25% killed only children. We also see that female serial killers generally murder within their local area. Female serial killers tend to kill victims by poisoning, suffocation, and staged accidents.

Narcissism can be divided into two factors: grandiose (sometimes referred to as overt), and vulnerable (sometimes referred to as covert or hypersensitive). Grandiose narcissism has characteristics like arrogance, a sense of entitlement, and being socially bold. It's associated with a high level of extraversion. Vulnerable narcissism has characteristics like being resentful, hypersensitive, having social insecurity, being defensive, and being avoidant. It's associated with a low level of extraversion. Vulnerable narcissism seems to have a lot in common with borderline personality disorder, but the overlap is limited.
Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) also has nine symptom criteria in the DSM: a grandiose sense of self-importance; fantasies about wealth and power, believing oneself to be special or unique, requiring excessive admiration from others, a sense of entitlement, a tendency to exploit other people interpersonally, a lack of empathy, envy, and arrogance.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

A number of gestures have been ostensibly been connected to specific motives or behaviors: closing one's eyes, scratching the neck, touching the nose, covering the mouth, not making eye contact, making too much eye contact, rate of speech, crossed arms, and blink rate. Although many of these body gestures have meaning, they can't be used to reliably detect deception.

1685,The Four Types of Impulsivity | Why is it so destructive?,2019-03-10,72079,2562,244,"This video answers the question: What is impulsivity? Impulsivity is an interesting construct - it's associated with a number of diagnostic classifications (mental disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual). Some of these mental disorders have impulsivity directly as a symptom and for others impulsivity is really just more of an associated characteristic. We see that with clinical and non-clinical populations - so individuals who have mental disorders and are being treated and individuals who don't - impulsivity has a negative impact on social adjustment, work, school success as well as physical and mental health. We know that impulsivity increases the risk of engaging a lot of behaviors that are considered problematic in our society: gambling, risky sex, substance use, suicidal behavior, binge eating, aggression, and violence.

There is single definition for impulsivity, but rather we see a number of terms associated with impulsivity like lack of forethought, risk-taking, inattention, lack of control, failing to plan, excitement seeking, novelty seeking, and quick decision-making.

One popular way of understanding impulsivity is the four-factor model called the UPPS model. This acronym stands for urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and sensation-seeking.

I've heard a lot of different questions over the years about this topic and the overwhelmingly majority of people in the mental health community want to prevent suicide. They view suicide as a negative outcome. However, there are some in the general public and a few in the mental health community that challenge this stance.
I've heard many times about this concept of “rational suicide.” This idea that an individual can rationally make a decision to end their own life. A lot of times when you hear the term rational suicide, we're really talking about a completely different situation than we're talking about in mental health settings.

The only real advice here is to see a counselor because there's just too many variables in this type of situation to know what to do to. This decision requires personalized professional attention. I'm really just speaking generally about this topic now. One area I could answer here, and this is maybe a little bit unexpected, if someone's not mentally ill then they shouldn't tell their employer that they are mentally ill. Now of course that's not what the question is getting at. The question is presuming the individual has a mental illness and they're debating whether to tell their employer or not, but certainly I want to look at all angles. Sometimes people who have mental illness think about telling their employer about the mental illness with the hope of getting some sort of adjustment to their work duties, which is understandable. However, discrimination against those with mental disorders complicates this decision.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1690,Personality Disorders and the Insanity Defense | Antisocial Personality Disorder & Psychopathy,2019-03-04,7943,327,51,"This video attempts to answer the question: Can personality disorders be used as a criminal defense? This is really talking about is the “insanity defense” and can that be applied if somebody has a personality disorder. An important disclaimer: I have a PhD in counselor education and supervision - I'm not an attorney. 
When we explore a term like the insanity defense, we're talking about the intersection of law and mental health and right away, this is a dangerous intersection.
The insanity defense requires a minimum threshold and that is “mental disease or defect,” which we now interpret as mental illness or mental disorder. We know that this mental disorder component is necessary but not sufficient to establish an insanity defense. In order for an individual to be found legally insane they must prove that as a result of a mental disorder they were functionally impaired in a legally relevant way at the time of the offense. If we look at the technical definition, we would go to the American Law Institute Model Penal Code. This has been adopted in many jurisdictions: “a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.” 
The definition for mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior. 
Personality disorders, in general, do not qualify as mental disorders as related to the insanity defense.

General description of antisocial personality disorder, psychopathy, sociopathy:
ASPD is a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's a Cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders. Antisocial personality disorder affects about 3% of the population, but depending on what literature you look at, it may affect up to 80% of the population in correctional settings. We see the definition of antisocial personality is broken to a few different criteria: a tendency to violate social norms (committing actions that could be grounds for arrest), deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability or aggression, a disregard for the safety of others, irresponsibility, and a lack of remorse. In order for somebody diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder they must be at least 18 years of age. Conduct disorder symptoms must have been present before the age of 15, so just as is the case with all personality disorders, there is no such thing as late onset antisocial personality disorder. The antisocial behavior cannot occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Moving on to the construct of psychopathy, we see here that psychopathy is an area that's studied, it's not a mental disorder. Someone can't really be diagnosed as having psychopathy or not, in a technical sense. Psychopathy affects about 1% of the population. In forensic settings about 16 percent of males are affected and about 7 percent of females are affected. Psychopathy can be divided into two factors and each of those factors can be divided into two facets. Factor one alone is sometimes referred to as psychopathy. Factor 2 is sometimes referred to as sociopathy. With psychopathy we have two factors and a total of four facets. Factor one is interpersonal/affective and factor two is referred to as social deviance. With the interpersonal facet we see certain characteristics like superficial charm, grandiosity, pathological lying, and a tendency to be manipulative. With the affective facet, we see a lack of remorse and shallow effect, callousness, lack of empathy. and a failure to accept responsibility. Moving to factor two (sociopathy) we see need for stimulation, parasitic lifestyle, lack of realistic long-term goals, impulsivity, irresponsibility, poor behavioral controls, early behavioral problems, juvenile delinquency, a revocation of conditional release, and criminal versatility.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

Mensa is a high IQ Society. The word Mensa isn't an acronym, rather a word from Latin meaning “table.” There is a Mensa international, that's the International Organization and then there's many national groups. It was formed in 1946 and the idea here was “to create a society that's non-political and free from all racial and religious distinctions” and the only qualification is that somebody has an IQ that's in the top 2% of the population.

1693,Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy | Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another,2019-03-01,58892,1903,442,"This video answers the question: What is Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. This disorder actually goes by a lot of names, so as I mentioned Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, but also just Munchausen Syndrome, and Munchausen by Proxy, but none of those are actually the official name of the disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, we see that the disorder is actually named factitious disorder imposed on another. There's another type of factitious disorder - factitious disorder imposed on self - and of course that's a different disorder.

We know that out of all the presentations of factitious disorder, only about 10% would qualify as imposed on another or Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.

If we look at the history of this disorder it actually dates back to 1951 in terms of the name Munchausen's syndrome as it was called first. The term was coined by a man named Richard Asher. A lot of people think the term was coined by a man named Munchausen, but that's not the case. Munchausen is actually the name of a German Baron who was a cavalry captain serving in a Russian regiment in campaigns against the Ottomans in the 18th century. Apparently, this particular cavalry captain had a lot of fabulous anecdotes and wild tales and that's why Asher named this disorder Munchausen syndrome.  He thought there was a similarity between the clients he was treating and Munchausen.

And (2) Can I offer a critique Richard Grannon Spartan Life Coach YouTube channel. This may seem unusual that I'm combining a theoretical model with a critique of a YouTube channel, but my main criticisms of Richard Grannon's channel revolve around neuro-linguistic programming, so I really have to explain NLP in order to explain my criticisms.
Neuro-linguistic programming coaches also go by a variety of names including certified life coach certified, NLP life coach, certified practitioner of NLP, certified master practitioner of NLP, and some refer to themselves as a certified hypnotherapist. NLP takes techniques and concepts from accepted empirically-based treatment modalities like cognitive behavior therapy, solution-focused therapy, motivational interviewing, psychodynamic therapy, and Gestalt therapy.
There's no single agreed upon definition for but here are seven philosophical and theoretical assumptions of NLP from a recent article:

1. Experience has a structure; there are patterns in the way individuals organize their experiences. 
2. The map is not the territory.
3. The mind and body are one system; there is a reciprocal relationship between mental and physical states.
4. People work perfectly - it is more useful to think of people as being effective at getting particular results
5. Individuals have all the resources that they need.
6. There is no failure, only feedback.
7. If what you’re doing is not working, try something else to be effective

1696,"Borderline Personality Disorder & Sexual Compulsivity | Sex Addiction, Hypersexuality, & Promiscuity",2019-02-25,122854,3762,463,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and sexual compulsivity (sexually compulsive behavior, compulsive sexual behavior, sex addiction, hypersexuality, promiscuity)? Sexual compulsivity is a lack of control of sexual behavior and using sexual behavior to cope with emotions. It has been associated with many negative consequences including: an increased risk of sexually transmitted infection, disruption of functioning, the consumption of time and energy. Sexual compulsivity is not currently listed as a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).
Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the DSM. It is a cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the general population is about 1% and there are a lot of studies with a lot of different prevalence figures, but overall it seems like 1% is reasonable in terms of a guess. In terms of gender prevalence, here we're not really sure. There are research studies that indicate that the prevalence is about equal between the genders, so roughly the same number of men are affected as women, but most studies indicate that more females would have borderline personality disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), we see nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder and five have to be met for a diagnosis. The symptom criteria include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in two areas that are potentially self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation.

I will also discuss open relationships and consensual non-monogamous relationships. The term open relationship is an umbrella term that covers a number of non-monogamous relationship types including polyamory. Polyamory also has different types, including solo polyamory and polyfidelity. Polyamory can be defined a number of ways. One popular definition is that polyamory is when people are in multiple loving relationships with no secrecy. Polyamory rejects the idea that one partner is capable of meeting all of the social, economic, intellectual, sexual, and emotional needs of another. There is a stigma associated with polyamory that is perpetuated by both the general population and a number of mental health questions, although competent treatment is available for individuals who are polyamorous. The prevalence of polyamory is thought to be around 4% of the population, however, because of the stigma and limited research the true prevalence of polyamory is not known.

The subminimum wage question is a controversial topic and relates to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

Many advocates for individuals with physical and mental health disabilities are opposed to some minimum-wage, and others would like to see this program stay in place.

The first type of narcissistic abuse is exposure abuse. This one's a fairly basic type of abuse. If someone is in a relationship with a person who is narcissistic, the arrogant and condescending behavior is embarrassing and could result in social isolation for the couple. This is a mild form of abuse or discomfort. The second type this gets much more serious and this is direct abuse. This is when somebody yells, screams, says derogatory remarks, and insults. This is not subtle and it has a fairly pronounced overlap with physical abuse. The third type of narcissistic abuse is insidious abuse. It is really the most common and when people use the term “narcissistic abuse” oftentimes this is what they're really talking about (this is the most discussed on YouTube) This abuse involves manipulation (e.g. gaslighting) It is about maintaining power and control. We also see the classic guilt trip and the wounded hero mentality. The fourth type of emotional abuse I'll talk about here I call emotional starvation, lack of affection and sensitivity, and sometimes I also refer to this as a lack of depth.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

Someone who would be more at risk to have an affair would tend to be high in openness to experience (intellectually curious, appreciate the arts, have a lot of imagination), low in conscientiousness (not very well organized and maybe, impulsive in terms of making decisions) high in extraversion (a lot of positive emotions, friendly, outgoing, assertive in social situations), low in agreeableness (uncooperative, tending not to trust other people), and high in neuroticism (tending to be angry, depressed, anxious, and feeling vulnerable)

Sometimes these are called the dark triad traits or referred to as the dark personality. The Dark Triad includes includes psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. 
When we think of the dark triad, we think of narcissism as the ‘lightest trait’ and psychopathy as the ‘darkest trait.’ These different traits have characteristics in common like empathy deficits, selfishness, a short-term mating style, as well as being competitive, antisocial, hedonistic, and having antagonism. We can think of antagonism as a low score on the agreeableness trait of the five-factor model. 
Narcissism in the dark triad is really grandiose narcissism. We see characteristics like arrogance, being socially dominant, being self-centered, a sense of entitlement, and a tendency to manipulate others (we see this characteristic with all three of the dark triad traits). Psychopathy characteristics include callousness; a lack of empathy, remorse, or guilt; violating society's norms; being irresponsible; being impulsive; having shallow effect; and superficial charm. The trait of Machiavellianism includes antisocial behaviors, but they're usually conceptualized as white-collar crime. We also see cynicism, having good impulse control (so this would differentiate Machiavellianism from psychopathy), callousness and being goal-oriented (usually we conceptualize the goal as being negative).",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande
1702,Autism Spectrum Disorder vs. Borderline & Narcissistic Personality Disorders,2019-02-20,131873,5284,920,"This video answers the question: How can we differentiate autism spectrum disorder from personality disorders? Specifically, when I talk about autism spectrum disorder, I'm referring to the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum and a presentation that doesn't have intellectual impairment. When we talk about autism spectrum disorder, we know that this particular type of presentation is often diagnosed late in life, it's often misdiagnosed, and a lot of the time it's confused with personality disorders. Autism spectrum disorder and personality disorders share a few different things in common and one of those features is they're both ego-syntonic, which means that there's a lack of insight it.

Autism spectrum disorder is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and here we see this disorder is characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction as well as restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, and activities. Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder are both Cluster B Personality Disorder. With BPD we see a pattern of unstable relationships, unstable mood, impulsivity, identity disturbance, anger, a chronic feeling of emptiness, and we also see an increased risk of suicidal ideation, gestures, threats, and other behaviors. NPD characteristics like being arrogant, jealous, having a lack of empathy, requiring excessive admiration, tending to manipulate people, and having a sense of entitlement.

The construct of psychopathy is interesting. It's not a mental disorder, although it has a relationship to antisocial personality disorder, which is a Cluster B personality in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Psychopathy is really a set of personality traits and it's measured on a continuum.
Psychopathy has a subclinical component, so somebody could have psychopathic traits and not qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, but also there appears to be a clinical element at the higher expression of psychopathy.

There two different types of psychopathy:  Factor 1 and Factor 2 (sometimes called primary and secondary). Factor 1 has superficial charm, grandiosity (similar to what we see with narcissism), callous/unemotional, pathological lying, manipulation, and a lack of remorse.
Factor 2 psychopathy we see some of the traits that more closely aligned with antisocial personality disorder like impulsivity, irresponsibility, and engaging in criminal behavior.

There are theories that the nature of psychopathy is reflected in language to such an extent that language can aid in the identification of psychopaths.

Psychopaths have certain characteristics that may be detectable in language:
- goal orientation
- focusing on basic needs
- deficits in interpreting and experiencing emotions

I review the evidence for and against this theory.

To get started with this question, it’s first important understand that some people who have personality disorders understand that they have a disorder. Others don't seem to have much awareness. Most people who have personality disorders have some awareness, but some areas with reduced awareness.

I'm going to start with a couple terms that I've used before other videos: ego-syntonic and ego-dystonic, and these terms come from the psychoanalytic school of thought. Ego-syntonic really means that somebody's emotions, behavior, cognitions are consistent with their values, beliefs, and their ideal self-image. Ego-dystonic means that their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors are inconsistent or unacceptable as compared to their values and beliefs.

Are avoidant personality disorders symptoms part of the recovery?

The construct of narcissism is a personality trait that tends to be stable over time. Most of the time we think of narcissism as normal and adaptive. When the levels become elevated, they can become problematic (pathological narcissism). Narcissism is also associated with being low on the agreeableness trait in the five-factor model, so being disagreeable. There are two types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism (overt) and vulnerable narcissism (covert). Grandiose narcissism has characteristics like being dominant, having a sense of entitlement, being extroverted (so high on extraversion in the five-factor model), callousness, a sense of superiority, and a tendency to exploit other individuals (manipulative). Vulnerable narcissism has characteristics like being insecure, fearful, being sad, being introverted (low on extraversion in the five-factor model), having what's referred to as shame-proneness (tending to experience shame), being hypersensitive, angry, and aggressive. Sometimes when we talk about these two types of narcissism, the term narcissistic personality disorder gets mentioned, but narcissistic personality disorder is different than grandiose or vulnerable narcissism. It's more similar to grandiose narcissism, but it's an official diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), so someone could be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, but could not be diagnosed with grandiose or vulnerable narcissism. Those are simply constructs measured on a continuum. Narcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, borderline, and histrionic.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

I've actually received a number of questions on materialism, which ask about the relationship between materialism and not only personality disorders, but other mental disorders and materialism as a philosophy. Materialism is desiring wealth and material goods to an excess degree. Related conditions or constructs include oniomania, compulsive buying, impulse buying, addictive buying, excessive buying, and even consumerism.
I'm going to focus on in particular the cluster B personality disorders and kind of demonstrate how there's a lot of similarities between materialism and those disorders. We see that there are four Cluster B personality disorders: antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic.

Antisocial personality disorder doesn’t have much overlap except perhaps with the impulsivity. Narcissistic personality disorder (and pathological narcissism, grandiose, vulnerable narcissism) have a lot of overlap with materialism. Fantasies of success, wealth, and power have a strong overlap. Borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder have some overlap with materialism.

I'm basing this answer a little bit more on my experience as opposed to research and the challenge with that of course is with comorbidity. A lot of times of course when we see personality disorder, we see one or more other personality disorders at the same time, so determining the effect of just one personality disorder can be difficult.

The ten personality disorders are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). They are grouped in the three clusters:
Cluster A: paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder 
Cluster B: antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder

The symptom criteria of schizotypal personality disorder are ideas of reference, odd beliefs or magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, odd thinking and speech, suspiciousness or paranoid ideation, inappropriate or constricted affect, behavior or appearance that's odd, peculiar, or eccentric, lack of close friends, excessive social anxiety because of paranoid fears.

These symptoms can be broken down into three categories:
1. cognitiveperceptual deficits (unusual perceptual experiences, magical thinking, ideas of reference/suspiciousness)
2. interpersonal difficulties (constricted affect/no close friends and excessive social anxiety)
3. disorganization (odd/eccentric behavior, odd speech)


The dark triad comprises three traits that can appear together and they're usually subclinical, meaning they don't have anything to do with mental health treatment or psychopathology. the three traits are psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. With all three of these traits we see manipulation of different types and then specifically with psychopathy, we see traits like being callous/unemotional, pathological lying, and having a lack of empathy, remorse, or guilt. Narcissism has arrogance, a sense of entitlement, being envious, having fantasies of success and power, feeling special or unique, and it also has a lack of empathy component. With Machiavellianism, we see someone who's ruthless, has a cynical view, and disregards conventional morality.

I titled this video “four things counselors don't know about bipolar disorder,” and when I use the word counselor here, I'm not using it in the professional identity sense, but rather in a general sense - so professional counselors, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, or anyone who can use psychotherapy to treat mental health symptoms. This video is in no way a criticism of the mental health professions, but rather just interesting facts about bipolar disorder that I think most mental health clinicians and most individuals in the general public wouldn't be aware of.

The first thing would be that hypomania appears in both Bipolar I Disorder and Bipolar II Disorder. A lot of times because of the way the criteria are written, counselors think that if somebody has Bipolar I Disorder they only have manic episodes, but actually they could also have hypomanic episodes.

The second thing that most counselors wouldn't know about bipolar disorder I call this the one-way street phenomenon of bipolar disorder. As long as someone has been correctly diagnosed, if they move to Bipolar I Disorder from Bipolar II Disorder or MDD, they can't move back to the diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder Or MDD.

The third thing that most counselors would not know about bipolar disorder deals with the construct of rapid cycling. A number of mental health clinicians know that rapid cycling exists, but don't really understand all the aspects of it, ultra rapid cycling and ultradian rapid cycling.

The fourth thing that most counselors don’t know about bipolar disorder this deals with a personality disorder called borderline personality disorder. The item here is that bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder can be comorbid.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

The first thing I want to do is draw the distinction between malingering, factitious disorder, and somatic symptom disorder. These disorders are relatively rare. Malingering is not a mental disorder, rather it is a V code, so it's really a condition and it can be the focus of clinical attention, but it's not something that somebody can be diagnosed like a mental disorder.

Malingering is when somebody fakes mental health symptoms (or physical health symptoms) for external gain and activity is deliberate. Factitious disorder is actually somewhat similar, except it is a mental disorder, but the faking of mental health symptoms is done for sympathy, not for money or any other material gain.
Somatic symptom disorder is really quite different from those other two. Somatic symptom disorder is when somebody has real symptoms that are not explained. There's no other explanation for the symptoms but they seem to have something to do with the mental health side as opposed to having a physical cause.

This is an interesting question and is actually a question I received many times in many different forms. Another popular question is: How many people in the population have a mental disorder?

Research indicates that 25% people have a mental illness right at this moment, so really another way to look at that is at any given time 25% of population will qualify for a mental disorder as classified in the DSM. Other research that indicates that at some point during a person's lifetime there's a 50% chance that they will develop a mental disorder, although we have some longitudinal studies (these are studies that look at the same people over a long period of time) that show this number is closer to 85%. Even at that 85% estimate, we think this is underestimated as there are a lot of people that don't want to report mental illnesses.

What the question is really asking here is: Is there some sort of characteristic that in some meaningful way, really links these two together conceptually, so that we can look at the same origin or central characteristic in both disorders.
 
With NPD, we see grandiosity, having fantasies of success and power, jealousy, entitlement, arrogance, feeling special or unique, manipulating other people, needing admiration, and having a lack of empathy. Borderline personality disorder has nine symptoms: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, splitting in relationships (unstable relationship pattern), identity disturbance (unstable self-image), impulsivity, suicidal behavior, emotional dysregulation, a feeling of emptiness anger, and paranoia.

The dark triad comprises three traits that can appear together and they're usually subclinical, meaning they don't have anything to do with mental health treatment or psychopathology. the three traits are psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. With all three of these traits we see manipulation of different types and then specifically with psychopathy, we see traits like being callous/unemotional, pathological lying, and having a lack of empathy, remorse, or guilt. Narcissism has arrogance, a sense of entitlement, being envious, having fantasies of success and power, feeling special or unique, and it also has a lack of empathy component. With Machiavellianism, we see someone who's ruthless, has a cynical view, and disregards conventional morality. There's quite a bit of overlap between these dark triad traits.

1723,Six Therapeutic Mistakes that Counselors / Therapists Make,2019-01-25,47183,2053,342,"This video answers the question: Can I review some of the common therapeutic mistakes that counselors tend to make. Here I'm not talking about signs of a bad counselor - I've talked about that before - rather just mistakes that I've seen in the practice of counseling. When I use the term counselor, I'm using it more in a general sense - so professional counselors, but also social workers, psychologists, and anyone who uses psychotherapy as part of their practice.

I assembled six counselor mistakes six therapeutic mistakes that I've seen a few times during my experience as a counselor and as a supervisor:

1. When getting a new client a counselor assumes that the last diagnosis is correct - so really skipping the assessment phase.
2. Writing poor progress notes – unclear, nebulous notes
3. Overreacting to a revelation by the client – counselors must be prepared for surprises
4. Excessively noticing nonverbal behaviors the moment that they happen – Nonverbal communication is important, but mostly themes are acknowledged rather than single events
5. Pretending to follow the narrative – Interrupting is a critical skill
6. Not admitting mistakes – Learning from mistakes allows counselors to be more effective",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1724,What is the Best Personality Profile? | Optimal Mental Health Personality on FFM,2019-01-24,34002,1518,157,"This video attempts to answer the question: What is the best personality profile?
Another way to think of this question is: What personality profile has the optimal mental health associated with it?

The answer is expressed using the five-factor model of personality (FFM). The FFM looks at personality as being in five big traits, sometimes they're called the big five. I remember them through the acronym OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of these five traits has six facets.
For example, with extraversion, we see warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement-seeking, and positive emotions. To come up with a healthy profile, the article reference below used a number of instruments and experts. What is the healthy personality profile that they came up with? Simply put, its high openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion. and agreeableness, and low in neuroticism. Being more specific looking at the facet level, it's high scores and low scores on particular facets: openness to experience - high feelings and average fantasy; conscientiousness – high competence; extraversion - high warmth and positive emotions and average excitement-seeking; agreeableness - high straightforwardness and average modesty; and neuroticism - low score on angry hostility.

There's a lot of confusion about delusions and when something rises to the level of delusional. A delusion is a fixed false belief that doesn't change in light of conflicting evidence. Delusions get confused with hallucinations. Hallucinations represent a separate construct: this is when somebody sees something other people can't see or hears or something other people can't hear or otherwise senses something other people cannot sense. Oftentimes delusions and hallucinations go together like in certain disorders, but they don't necessarily have to appear together. 

Delusions are consistent with the concept of psychosis - they break from reality. When someone is psychotic, 65% of the time we would see the delusions. 
Certain mental disorders may be associated with delusions: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder.

When we think about these three constructs, this is referred to as the dark triad. 

Psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism are conceptualized as subclinical. The dark triad is not about mental disorders like antisocial personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder.

The term Machiavellianism this comes from a political philosopher that lived about 500 years ago named Niccolo Machiavelli and he wrote a book named The Prince. The book outlined these different constructs like being ruthless and doing anything to gain power and a lot of different types of characteristics that we now see in this construct of Machiavellianism.

What this question is really getting at is: Can borderline personality disorder have a psychotic component to it that doesn't have another explanation? First, I will briefly review borderline personality disorder and psychosis. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. This is called the dramatic, erratic, and emotional cluster. There are nine symptom criteria associated with borderline personality disorder: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, an unstable relationship pattern, identity disturbance, impulsivity at least two areas that could be self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, inappropriate intense anger, a chronic feeling of emptiness, and the last one is paranoid ideation and severe dissociation.
Psychosis is a construct that we see in a number of disorders and what it essentially means is a break from reality. The way we know psychosis is occurring is usually through hallucinations, delusions, or both. Hallucinations would be seeing or hearing something that other people can't see or hear or otherwise perceiving something they can't perceive. Delusions would be a fixed, false belief that doesn't change even when there's evidence that shows that that belief is not correct.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande

Which mental disorders are uncommon among mental health counselors? Which mental disorders are disproportionately prevalent among mental health counselors? They are certain mental disorders that appear to be underrepresented among the population of practicing psychotherapists (professional counselors, psychologists, social workers, and other related professions). Mental disorders like personality disorders, intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and some others appear to be relatively uncommon. Mental a higher prevalence in the mental health counselor population would include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. There are a variety reasons why this is the case. Mental disorders that have an association with criminality would be underrepresented because it's difficult to find employment as a mental health counselor with a criminal record. Mental disorders that are overrepresented may be observed because individuals with these disorders developed an interest in counseling or because the disorders were developed as a result of being exposed to traumatic events and stress as a counselor. There are also a variety of reasons why mental health counselors would not seek treatment including limited access, low comfort level, low trust for other counselors, and the stigma associated with mental disorders.

1729,Schadenfreude & Narcissism | Joy in the Pain of Others,2019-01-17,41863,1600,312,"This video answers the question: Can I review the construct of schadenfreude? Schadenfreude is when somebody takes joy in another's misfortune. It comes from two German words “schaden” (misfortune or harm) and “freude” (joy). A lot of times when we look at the research literature, we see that schadenfreude is generally considered harmful, especially if it tends to occur repeatedly. It has an antisocial component and it's often thought of as morally questionable. Schadenfreude also exists on a personal and a social level.
I've heard that people consider envy the opposite of schadenfreude, but actually that's not true. There's another term freudenfreude, which is when you support the success of other people. It’s when you feel joy because other people have success. That's really the opposite of envy. Just because schadenfreude isn't the opposite of envy, doesn't mean it doesn't have a relationship with envy. I think it's actually aligned with envy. In one sense, schadenfreude really satisfies envy. If you feel a negative feeling because somebody else has success, then something bad happens to them, and you feel joy because of that misfortune, that satisfies the envy. That kind of takes care of the envy feeling and replaces the negative feeling of envy with the positive feeling of schadenfreude.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1730,"The Truth about ""Narcissistic Abuse Syndrome"" | ""Narcisstic Victim Syndrome""",2019-01-16,181921,4412,1533,"This video answers the question: Can I talk about this trend we see in blogs and YouTube about “narcissistic abuse syndrome.” Narcissistic abuse syndrome has a few other names like “narcissistic victim syndrome” or “narcissistic abuse victim syndrome.”

Narcissistic abuse syndrome is this is not actually a disorder. There's no classification in the DSM that lines up with this idea. What we have here is really a poor understanding of narcissism and of classification with the DSM. The sources that promote this idea are often blaming science by suggesting that individuals who are narcissistic learn to be narcissistic by reading scientific literature and this leads to this abuse syndrome. They suggest that the only way of knowing something is if you experience to yourself, so if somebody has lived with a narcissist or interacted with the narcissist, they are the only people that can understand narcissism. We also see attempts at generating a treatment protocol for this disorder that of course isn't a disorder and one of the treatments is to learn a lot about narcissists.
Another trend I see with this narcissistic abuse syndrome situation is that people say that if clinicians won't diagnose this “syndrome,” then someone should go to life coach. We see here individuals who potentially have mental health symptoms being redirected from qualified clinicians over to life coaches and promoting an unregulated business.
Life coaches aren't equipped to treat mental health symptoms, but that's what this whole narcissistic abuse syndrome promotion is doing another.
There are so many problems with this “syndrome.” It just seems so illogical and it is harmful to the individuals that counselors would treat. This trend needs to be dismissed we need to move past sensationalism, drama, and whatever's going on with the money and the life coaching and move back to science. Let's use the methods that we've used before that we know work to come up with answers that can help people. We don’t need a new industry around narcissism.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande

First, it's important understand that these are different disorders. OCD has obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (behaviors that are meant to satisfy the anxiety) created by the obsessions. Usually people with OCD have good insight, but not always, and we consider the behaviors in general to be ego-dystonic. Obsessive compulsive personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder, which is the same cluster as avoidant and dependent personality disorders. With OCPD, we see someone who's perfectionistic, they don't like to delegate responsibilities to someone unless that person can do it exactly as prescribed, a miserly spending style, and a restricted range of emotion. We consider the characteristics with OCPD to be ego-syntonic.

This is a complex question because these constructs are complex. I'm going to start by defining both of the terms. When we use the term psychopath, we're talking about some who has trait psychopathy and when we use the term narcissist, we're talking about someone who has trait narcissism. Neither one of these constructs is automatically indicative of pathology. If somebody has psychopathy that doesn't mean they have a mental disorder and if somebody has narcissism that doesn't mean to have a mental disorder. Mental disorders are classifications we see in places like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), but they don't necessarily relate to traits like certain traits that cluster together that we would call psychopathy or we would call narcissism. Psychopathy has two main types and narcissism does as well. With psychopathy, we see there's both primary and secondary psychopathy (sometimes these are called factor 1 and factor 2 psychopathy). Narcissism has two types: grandiose and vulnerable.
Primary psychopathy has characteristics like being callous, unemotional, pathological lying, being manipulative, and being bold (fearless dominance). Secondary psychopathy has characteristics like being irresponsible, being impulsive, having a need for stimulation, and being involved in activities that could result in arrest. Grandiose narcissism has fantasies of success and power, jealousy, a sense of entitlement, arrogance, and being manipulative. With vulnerable narcissism, we see some of the same characteristics like insecurity, hypersensitivity to criticism, shame, guilt, and sadness.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande

NPD has symptoms like a sense of entitlement, having fantasies of success, manipulating other people, being arrogant, and lacking empathy. Grandiose narcissism a lot of the same characteristics as NPD. With grandiose narcissism, we would also see social dominance and assertiveness. One way we could think about it is when we look at the term narcissism, somebody who has grandiose narcissism would probably appear narcissistic to most people right away because of that arrogant behavior and being condescending. Vulnerable narcissism isn't really captured well at all by the mental disorder NPD. We see characteristics with vulnerable narcissism like insecurity, having shame-proneness, being hypersensitive, sad, and shy.

There could be different presentations of a disorder in men versus women and we do see this with a number of disorders, like antisocial personality disorder.

There are a lot of different adjectives to describe this particular phenomenon. To understand the sociopathic stare or the psychopathic stare, we need to understand a little bit about psychopathy versus sociopathy and how that relates to antisocial personality disorder. Psychopathy has two factors: factor 1 and factor 2. With Factor 1 (interpersonal/affective), we see traits like superficial charm, grandiosity, callousness, unemotional, fearless dominance manipulativeness, having a lack of empathy, shallow affect and pathological lying. Factor 2 (social deviance) has a different set of characteristics: excitement-seeking, parasitic lifestyle, impulsivity, irresponsibility, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility. Factor 2 psychopathy is much closer to the diagnosis in the DSM of antisocial personality disorder than Factor 1 psychopathy. A lot of times when we talk about sociopathy we're really talking about factor 2 psychopathy, which is why the sociopathic stare is really probably better referred to as the psychopathic stare.

There are a wide variety of conspiracy theories including: vaccinations, global warming, chemtrails, flat earth, no moon landing, area 51, cure for cancer being suppressed, and elite lizards (shape-shifting aliens) who seek world domination. Some conspiracy theories turned out to be supported by evidence like the CIA testing LSD on Americans and the government monitoring communications around the world. Many people believe in one or two conspiracy theories, but many conspiracy theorists believe in dozens. All conspiracy theories share one thing in common: large numbers of organized, evil people conspiring to cause harm. People may believe in conspiracy theories for many reasons, some of which have no relationship to personality and mental health. Others may tend to find meaning from randomness and believe it affects them personally (ideas of reference). We also see a tendency to hold odd beliefs and to have magical thinking. At a subclinical level, these traits align with schizotypy. Many conspiracy theorists feel uncertain, insecure, anxious, powerless, and isolated.
Why would conspiracies fail? People aren't good at conspiring, especially in the long run when the stakes are high. Some traits associated with deliberately or inadvertently revealing the truth are high altruism, low conscientiousness (not being careful), high neuroticism (impulsivity), high extraversion (talkative), narcissism (fantasy, jealously, lack of empathy, admiration), high adventurousness, and substance use.

1746,Do Mothers with Borderline Cause Borderline in Their Children?,2018-12-27,57105,2197,402,"This video answers the question: Can a mother with borderline personality disorder cause borderline personality disorder to manifest in a child. What this question is really asking is: Do we see such a thing as a transgenerational transmission of borderline personality disorder? 
We see that there's a genetic contribution that we need to understand before getting to the environmental contribution. We know that the heritability is about 40 – 60%, so around half on average so. That's a lot of variance that's explained and of course we really can't do anything about the genetic side, we can only really focus on the environmental side in terms of treatment.
Some basic information about BPD: Borderline personality disorder is a cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the general population is about 1% and there are a lot of studies with a lot of different prevalence figures, but overall it seems like 1% is reasonable in terms of a guess. In terms of gender prevalence, here we're not really sure. There are research studies that indicate that the prevalence is about equal between the genders, so roughly the same number of men are affected as women, but most studies indicate that more females would have borderline personality disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), we see nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder and five have to be met for a diagnosis. The symptom criteria include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in two areas that are potentially self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. It's estimated that about 10% of individuals with borderline personality disorder will complete suicide and about 60 to 80% of individuals with this disorder will have non-suicidal self-injury at some point in their life.

1747,The Flat Earth Movement and Personality,2018-12-27,31589,1365,1731,"This video answers the question: What possible personality profile might we see associated with the Flat Earth movement. This is a group that believes that the earth is flat as opposed to spherical and this isn't something that they're doing just to be funny or to kind of mix things up, rather many of the members of this group actually believe the earth is flat. There's a real conviction here in terms of belief. First, it's important to point out here that I can't and won't diagnose anybody who's not my client, so really here I'm just speculating about what we might see in terms of personality or mental health symptoms with some people that have this belief. There could be people that are members of that movement who have no mental health disorders and have a personality profile that's within normal limits. 
What could be going on here in terms of personality or mental health. There could be nothing going on - many of the members could simply look at this theory and be intrigued and join the movement. It could also be a sense of belonging. I think there is a financial incentive for people that run this. There could also be some extreme personality traits in play, here particularly, I would think low openness to experience (being very rigid and dogmatic) or very high openness to experience (extensive fantasy, creativity, and imagination) There could be low agreeableness - simply being a contrarian. In terms of mental health, there are a lot of potential explanations: paranoid personality features, schizotypal personality features, schizophrenia, and there's some other disorders as well that have a delusional component. When we look at what qualifies as a delusion, it would be when somebody believes something is contrary to overwhelming significant evidence, and that seems to be what's going on here some of the time. Again, there are a lot of reasons somebody could join an organization like this or have these beliefs - a delusional frame of mind would just be one of these reasons.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1748,Is Antisocial Personality Disorder Different in Men and Women?,2018-12-26,17017,609,15,"This video answers the question: Is there any difference between men and women who present with antisocial personality disorder? Antisocial personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This is the emotional, erratic, and dramatic cluster. It is the same cluster that contains narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders. The DSM definition of antisocial personality disorder contains seven symptom criteria:  repeatedly violating social norms, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability and aggression, disregard for the safety of self or others, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse. We know that in order for an individual be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, they have to be 18 years of age or older and there must be evidence of conduct disorder before the age of 15. There is no such thing as late onset antisocial personality disorder.

1749,Ebenezer Scrooge's Five Factor Model Personality Profile | Are there Dark Triad Traits?,2018-12-25,3298,238,46,"This video describes the Five-Factor Personality Profile of a fictional character name Ebenezer Scrooge. Ebenezer Scrooge was the protagonist in an 1843 novel named A Christmas Carol, which was written by Charles Dickens. I also discuss what we can learn about personality from the novel.

The Five-Factor Model of Personality can be remembered by the acronym OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

I also look at this character in light of the Dark Triad. The Dark Triad has three traits: psychopathy, narcissism, and machiavellianism. Psychopathy has two factors: factor 1 and factor 2. Each of these factors has two facets. Factor 1 psychopathy is interpersonal and affective. On the interpersonal side we see traits like superficial charm, grandiosity, pathological lying, and being manipulative. On the affective side we see traits like lack of remorse, lack of empathy, and callousness. Factor 1 is associated with a low level of agreeableness and a high level of extraversion on the five-factor model. Factor 2 is referred to as the social deviance factor and again it has two facets: lifestyle and antisocial. The lifestyle facet has characteristics like impulsivity and irresponsibility. The antisocial facet has characteristics like poor behavioral controls and criminal versatility. Factor 2 is associated with low level of conscientiousness, low level of extraversion, and a high level of neuroticism. Narcissism can be divided into two factors: grandiose (sometimes referred to as overt), and vulnerable (sometimes referred to as covert or hypersensitive). Grandiose narcissism has characteristics like arrogance, a sense of entitlement, and being socially bold. It's associated with a high level of extraversion.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1750,Can Large Age Difference Relationships Succeed? | May-December Romance,2018-12-23,209196,6992,1940,"This video answers the question: Can large age difference relationships succeed? These relationships, sometimes called May-December Romances, are somewhat uncommon (8% of heterosexual couples) and come with certain challenges not experienced by couples with small age differences. Large age difference relationships are typically defined as a relationship where there's 10 or more years separating the couple. A lot of times we think of this as applying to a man who's older than a woman, but doesn't have to be that way. We know from the literature that these relationships have a higher probability of failure and they have lower level of satisfaction associated with them. Of course, this isn't the case with every relationship where there's an age difference of 10 years or more, but this is what we see as a tendency in the literature. Although the challenges can be significant, counseling may help couples in this situation to navigate these relationships. Many May-December relationships are successful, but it often requires facing some of the challenges associated with the age difference honestly and directly.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1751,What is Hypersexuality? | Compulsive Sexual Behavior,2018-12-22,109546,2344,245,"This video answers the question: What is hypersexuality? Hypersexuality is an interesting construct. We don't actually have one agreed-upon definition for it, but there have been many articles written about the construct and their many theories about it. Sometimes hypersexuality is referred to as problematic hypersexuality. We see certain traits with hypersexuality like compulsive sexual behavior, exaggerated sexual behavior, and intense sexual fantasies. These are all part of a construct, not a mental disorder like we would see in a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. There is no DSM hypersexuality disorder, for example. Hypersexuality appears to affect about 5 – 10% of the general population and it appears to have an onset in early adulthood. There are several associated characteristics with hypersexuality: high sex drive, compulsive sexual behavior, impairment, obsessive focus on sexual stimuli, emotional dysregulation, increased interest in paraphilic activities, decreased life satisfaction, increased contact with the criminal justice system, and increased substance use. There are some symptoms with this construct that are similar to what we see with mental disorders and there are some negative consequences that seem to have similarities with a few mental disorders.

1753,Is Life Coaching a Scam?,2018-12-19,56552,2474,665,"This video answers the questions: Is life coaching a scam? How does it relate to counseling? Should I become a life coach or should I become a counselor? What can I expect to get from life coaching? Is it a substitute for counseling? When we talk about life coaching one of the difficulties here is there's no real single definition for this construct. Life coaching is an unregulated field, so anyone with or without training can go out at any time and open up a life coaching business as long as they're in line with other applicable laws. There are no laws that I'm aware of that regulate life coaching. Counseling is regulated. Counselors at some point, we would hope, achieve level of licensure and that's the level where they can bill insurance companies. They have other certain rights and privileges like the ability to diagnose.
They go through certain steps like education, testing, and postgraduate supervision to make sure they reach a level of competency. None of those safeguards exist in life coaching. Just because something's not regulated doesn't automatically make it a scam, but it certainly makes it more vulnerable to be a scam in any particular instance.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande

ADHD is a disorder where we see inattention, hyperactive impulsive behavior, or both. The disorder has three subtypes, so in order for somebody be diagnosed with ADHD they have to be diagnosed with the inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, or combined presentation. There's no way to have the diagnosis and not have one of those subtypes.
Antisocial personality disorder it is a cluster B personality disorder and there are seven symptom criteria associated with it: a tendency to violate society's norms (engaging in behaviors that are grounds for arrest), deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability and aggression, disregarding one's own safety and disregarding the safety of others, being irresponsible, and having a lack of remorse. The prevalence of antisocial personality is thought to be somewhere around 1% it may be as high as over 3%.

1755,Do Narcissists Choose to have Trait Narcissism?,2018-12-17,46168,2180,317,"This video answers the question: Can people choose to have trait narcissism? The construct of narcissism is a personality trait that tends to be stable over time. Most of the time we think of narcissism as normal and adaptive. When the levels become elevated, they can become problematic (pathological narcissism). Narcissism is also associated with being low on the agreeableness trait in the five-factor model, so being disagreeable. There are two types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism (overt) and vulnerable narcissism (covert). Grandiose narcissism has characteristics like being dominant, having a sense of entitlement, being extroverted (so high on extraversion in the five-factor model), callousness, a sense of superiority, and a tendency to exploit other individuals (manipulative). Vulnerable narcissism has characteristics like being insecure, fearful, being sad, being introverted (low on extraversion in the five-factor model), having what's referred to as shame-proneness (tending to experience shame), being hypersensitive, angry, and aggressive. Sometimes when we talk about these two types of narcissism, the term narcissistic personality disorder gets mentioned, but narcissistic personality is different than grandiose or vulnerable narcissism. Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) also has nine symptom criteria in the DSM: a grandiose sense of self-importance; fantasies about wealth and power, believing oneself to be special or unique, requiring excessive admiration from others, a sense of entitlement, a tendency to exploit other people interpersonally, a lack of empathy, envy, and arrogance. The construct of pathological narcissism doesn't overlap perfectly with narcissistic personality disorder. There are two factors to pathological narcissism: grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism seems to have a lot in common with borderline personality disorder, but the overlap is not perfect.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande

1757,Is Earning a Ph.D. Worth the Cost? | Master's vs. Ph.D. in Counseling,2018-12-14,31205,1368,202,"This video answers the question: Is earning a Ph.D. in counselor education and supervision worth it? How does the Ph.D. compare to the master's degree? This is specific to counseling, but I think at some level it's also applicable to related fields like marriage and family therapy, social work, and psychology I think that you have to consider the questions around this area in a particular order and maybe the first question would be: What do I want to do? A Ph.D. isn't really so much an identity as a level of education. As far as doing it strictly for an identity - like just to be able to call yourself a doctor or PhD - I don't think this really makes a lot of sense. The Ph.D. is very difficult to get and it's very expensive, so to earn it just to be able to call yourself a doctor seems like a real waste of resources all the way around. If you really did want just the identity, there are doctoral level degrees there much easier to get than a Ph.D. in counselor education and supervision.
Another question you may want to ask first would be: Am I good at math? I think this is a question a lot of doctoral students or people consider applying to doctoral programs don't really consider very well, but statistics is a huge part of a Ph.D. Another related question would be: Do I like to write? Writing is a huge part of getting at Ph.D. It is important to look at the cost-benefit of getting a Ph.D. The financial, time, and effort factors should be considered. Overall, earning a Ph.D. is not a good idea for most individuals, but for some it is well worth the costs.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1758,"Dark Triad and Sexual Fantasies | Narcissism, Psychopathy, Machiavellianism",2018-12-12,146393,4645,372,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between the dark triad traits and sexual fantasies? The dark triad comprises three personality traits narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. When we think of the dark triad, we think of narcissism as the ‘lightest trait’ and psychopathy as the ‘darkest trait.’ These different traits have characteristics in common like empathy deficits, selfishness, a short-term mating style, as well as being competitive, antisocial, hedonistic, and having antagonism. We can think of antagonism as a low score on the agreeableness trait of the five-factor model. 
Narcissism in dark triad is really grandiose narcissism. We see characteristics like arrogance, being socially dominant, being self-centered, a sense of entitlement, and a tendency to manipulate others (we see this characteristic with all three of the dark triad traits). Psychopathy characteristics include callousness; a lack of empathy, remorse, or guilt; violating society's norms; being irresponsible; being impulsive; having shallow effect; and superficial charm. The trait of Machiavellianism includes antisocial behaviors, but they're usually conceptualized as white-collar crime. We also see cynicism, having good impulse control (so this would differentiate Machiavellianism from psychopathy), callousness and being goal-oriented (usually we conceptualize the goal as being negative).
The first sexual fantasy is “intimate.” This is the most common fantasy. Here we see a sense of attachment and familiarity. This is when somebody wants to connect with a sexual partner at the emotional level. The next sexual fantasy is referred to as “exploratory.” Here we see a commission of diverse acts, like mate swapping or promiscuity. The next one is the “impersonal” fantasy. Here we see characteristics like being emotionally detached and disinterested, for example, fetishism. The last sexual fantasy theme is the ""sadomasochistic"" fantasy. Here we see causing or submitting to physical or emotional abuse.

The term ‘core” refers to the most basic, central concept that we can link to borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, histrionic, and narcissistic, personality disorders. This cluster is the dramatic, erratic, and emotional cluster. The symptom criteria for borderline personally disorder include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment; unstable relationships (idealization and devaluation, love/hate cycle); identity disturbance (unstable sense of self); impulsivity and at least two areas that could be self-damaging; suicidal behavior; affective instability (emotional dysregulation); chronic feelings of emptiness; inappropriate, intense anger; and paranoid ideation or severe dissociation.

1760,Psychopathy and Intermittent Explosive Disorder,2018-12-10,26362,837,100,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between psychopathy and intermittent explosive disorder? Intermittent explosive disorder is a mental disorder listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This diagnosis involves recurrent behavioral outbursts. The aggression can be low intensity and high frequency or high intensity low frequency. These recurrent behavioral outbursts must be out of proportion to the level of provocation and they cannot be premeditated. They have to be impulsive or anger-based. 
The distress or impairment and can't be better explained by another mental disorder including antisocial personality disorder, which of course has a relationship to psychopathy. It's important to note here that intermittent explosive disorder can still be comorbid with antisocial personality, there just can't have a situation where the recurrent behavioral outbursts are better explained by antisocial personality disorder or there would be no diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder, rather we would just see a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder assigned.
The most popular conceptualization of psychopathy involves two factors: factor 1 (primary psychopathy), which we could think of as callous/unemotional and characteristics like lack of empathy, remorse, guilt as well as superficial charm, deceitfulness, and grandiosity; factor 2 (secondary psychopathy) which we could also think of as the social deviant factor, here we have antisocial behavior, impulsivity, irresponsibility, lack of clear goals, and lack of behavioral controls.

1761,What is High-Functioning Depression? | Is the term needed?,2018-12-08,58117,1885,198,"This video answers the question: What is meant by the term high-functioning depression? High-functioning depression is not a mental disorder, rather it's a term used in the popular culture to describe symptoms of depression that have a minimal effect on functioning at work, in school, or in social activities. It's analogous to an old mental disorder called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder, which referred to a set of depressive symptoms that were low-grade and tended to last several years. To better understand the construct, it's important to understand major depressive disorder and a disorder called persistent depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder is a chronic disorder and the symptoms have to be present for at least two weeks for a diagnosis. There's a list of symptoms in the symptom criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and here we see that five or more symptoms need to be endorsed. One of these symptoms must be either depressed mood or diminished interest or pleasure in activities. We see other symptoms associated with the disorder as well including a change in weight or change in appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation. When these symptoms occur and some other different criteria are met, someone can have major depressive disorder. Persistent depressive disorder has depressed mood and the symptoms must be present for at least two years. In addition to depressed mood, two or more symptoms from the symptom criteria must be met and we see symptoms like poor appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, a decrease in self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, and hopelessness. We see there's a bit of overlap between the symptom criteria for PDD and MDD, but the overlap is not perfect.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande

Also, I will discuss the relationship between Maladaptive Daydreaming and OCD, ADHD, and addiction. Maladaptive Daydreaming is a construct and not currently a mental disorder. It is not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Maladaptive Daydreaming is characterized by highly structured daydreams, including those that have elaborate plots and fictional characters. The condition can yield enjoyment but also leads to a disruption of functioning, which has led to it being compared to substance use disorder. Some counselors diagnose individuals with Maladaptive Daydreaming with OCD or ADHD, because there is some overlap between Maladaptive Daydreaming and those disorders. There is no disorder in the DSM that features highly structured daydreams as a primary symptom. 
Those with Maladaptive Daydreaming differ from those who have normal daydreaming in several ways. Those with Maladaptive Daydreaming spend an average of 56 – 57% of their waking hours daydreaming, compared to just 16% for those with normal daydreaming. Both those with and without the condition appear to have good control of the daydreaming when work or social demands would make the daydreaming extremely disruptive. 
Over 80% of those with Maladaptive Daydreaming also have repetitive movements. Maladaptive Daydreaming is more strongly associated with obsessions than compulsions.

Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, histrionic, and narcissistic, personality disorders.

There are nine symptom criteria: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment; an unstable relationship pattern; identity disturbance; impulsivity in at least two areas that could be self-damaging; suicidal behavior, threats, ideations, and gestures; affective instability, a chronic feeling of emptiness, intense and inappropriate anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. Borderline personality disorder is a high rate of co-occurrence with pathological narcissism. One fairly common combination is borderline personality disorder comorbid with narcissistic personality disorder, and in clinical treatment settings this particular combination is considered particularly difficult to treat. Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) also has nine symptom criteria in the DSM: a grandiose sense of self-importance; fantasies about wealth and power, believing oneself to be special or unique, requiring excessive admiration from others, a sense of entitlement, a tendency to exploit other people interpersonally, a lack of empathy, envy, and arrogance.

1765,What are Paraphilic Disorders?,2018-11-30,57894,1286,195,"This video answers the question: What are paraphilic disorders? There are eight paraphilic disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). To understand them, we must first talk about paraphilia as a construct. A paraphilia is not the same thing as a paraphilic disorder and it's not the same thing as sexual dysfunction. The sexual dysfunctions are a completely different set of disorders in a different section of the DSM and they include disorders like female orgasmic disorder and erectile dysfunction, not the disorders we see in the paraphilic disorders section. Paraphilia is an intense and persistent sexual interest, other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling, with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners. What phenotypically means here is characteristics that we can observe in an organism. A paraphilia is necessary for a diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder, but it's not sufficient in and of itself. A paraphilia does not necessarily require or justify some sort of treatment. It can if a client has a paraphilia and they want that to be the focus of treatment, but it's not required. Paraphilic disorders, of course, are usually thought of as requiring or justifying treatment in most instances. There are two major paraphilic disorder categories in the DSM: anomalous activity preferences and anomalous target preferences. Under the anomalous activity preferences, we can further subdivide that into courtship disorders and algolagnic disorders. The courtship disorders have characteristics that seem to be distorted courtship behaviors like voyeuristic or frotteuristic disorder. The algolagnic disorders have the involvement of pain or suffering like sexual sadism disorder. The second broad category anomalous target preferences. As the name indicates is more about a target than an activity. Here we see disorders like fetishistic disorder. I mentioned before that a paraphilia is not a paraphilic disorder, so how can we differentiate paraphilias from paraphilic disorders. Well, we know there are eight paraphilic disorders and all of these eight disorders have at least a Criterion A and a Criterion B. Some of those sorters also have a Criterion C and, of course, some have specifiers and subtypes. Criterion A is really about the qualitative nature of the paraphilia. For example, sexual arousal from the suffering of another would be related to sexual sadism disorder. Criterion B is related to the negative consequences of that intense sexual interest and arousal. Here we would see clinically significant distress and perhaps functional impairment like in social, work, or school areas, or the disorder could be causing harm. Usually, the way we look at this is if Criterion A is met and Criterion B is met and any other criteria are also met, of course, that would be a paraphilic disorder. However, if Criterion A is met and criterion B is not met, we usually refer to this as a benign paraphilia. This is a paraphilia that does not have a clinical component to it. It's not classified as a disorder, rather it's just a condition and again it may be the focus of treatment or it may not.

1766,What is Gelotophobia? | Is it related to Social Anxiety Disorder & Avoidant Personality Disorder?,2018-11-28,9262,347,56,"This video answers the question: What is gelotophobia and what is its relationship to social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder? Gelotophobia is a fear of being laughed at and it's considered a specific phobia. We see that the symptoms associated with gelotophobia are quite similar to social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder like a fear of negative evaluation, embarrassment, withdrawal from social situations, and the physiological symptoms we see associated with social anxiety (e.g. palpitations, nausea, trembling, and sweating).
There's a lot of controversy between these social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder, including a theory that of avoidant personality disorder is not really a distinct classification. There is another theory that says that social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder are separate classifications and should remain that way. The last major theory is that avoidant personality disorder is distinct, but it's a form of generalized social anxiety disorder. I believe that the two are distinct but one area I will agree with in terms of what a lot of researchers believe about these disorders, is this idea that there's no difference between the treatments. This does seem to be supported by the evidence. Whether these two disorders are really distinct disorders or not the treatment protocol is fairly similar for both disorders. We see different theories about gelotophobia: it may be just a symptom of social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder, it may be like a specifier (like the performance only specifier that we see with social anxiety disorder), and it may be a subtype. A subtype is distinct from the concept of a specifier. A subtype is mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive, so if a disorder does have subtypes an individual has to have one of the subtypes to be diagnosed with that disorder. It's not optional like a specifier would be. 
This idea that there might be a relationship between all these disorders really makes a lot of sense if we think about laughter as an important social cue of acceptance or rejection.

1767,Humility and Death Anxiety,2018-11-27,2791,195,32,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between humility and death anxiety?
Humility is an accurate appraisal of self. This includes both the positive and negative attributes. What we see here is an ability to recognize limitations in a non-defensive way. This is not the same thing as a sense of inferiority, but rather the lack of self-aggrandizing. We also see a lack of self-focus associated with high humility. The sense of self is a complex construct. We can look at the sense of self as having a few different parts: self-esteem and self-serving bias. A strong sense of self, including high self-esteem, has been associated with good mental health and happiness, but in the long run it can lead to a distorted self-perception, which can lead to lower prosocial behaviors and a variety of other mental health consequences. A lot of times we think of high self-esteem as good and it may be in some sense, but a strong sense of self that has the self-serving biases, eventually leads to difficulties in the area of mental health. High levels of humility, on the other hand, have been associated with characteristics like generosity, being more likely to forgive others, being helpful, having good relationships, and it's been negatively associated with neuroticism and narcissism. How is humility linked to death anxiety? Death anxiety is worrying about dying, it's a type of existential crisis. Death anxiety has been associated with a number of negative characteristics. Because of some of the characteristics of humility, it's believed that it has a relationship with death anxiety where high humility results in lower death anxiety.
Research indicates that higher levels of humility and lower levels of entitlement are associated with lower levels of death anxiety. Lower levels of humility combined with reminders of death result in a higher fear of death and increased death anxiety. Higher levels of humility tend to prevent thoughts of mortality from resulting in decreased self-control.

Borderline personality disorder is associated with a number of symptom criteria including frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable or intense relationships (idealization-devaluation cycle), identity disturbance, impulsivity, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. Narcissistic personality disorder is associated with several symptom criteria including a grandiose sense of self-importance, having exaggerated fantasies of success, feeling special or unique, requiring excessive admiration, having a sense of entitlement, tending to exploit other people, having a lack of empathy, tending to envy other people or believing other people would envy then, and being arrogant. 
Comorbid presentations of borderline and narcissistic personality disorders are not uncommon. About 40% of individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder would also qualify for a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder.

Some basic information about BPD: Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This emotional, erratic, and dramatic cluster. It's in the same cluster as narcissistic, antisocial, and histrionic personality disorders. There are nine symptom criteria listed in the DSM for borderline personality disorder: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable pattern of relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in at least two areas where there's self damage, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation.",Nov,Dr. Todd Grande

Bipolar I Disorder is characterized by manic episodes and usually depressive episodes, although technically only a manic episode is required for diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder. Bipolar II Disorder is characterized hypomanic episodes, so the mania is not as severe as what we see in Bipolar I Disorder. We also see depressive episodes and the depressive episodes are required for diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder. Cyclothymic Disorder is similar to Bipolar II Disorder, except the full criteria for hypomanic episodes and depressive episodes aren't met in terms of quantity, severity, duration, or pervasiveness. Manic episodes have symptoms like grandiosity, a decreased need for sleep, being talkative, having racing thoughts, being easily distracted, being goal-directed, and acting in a manner that can lead to painful consequences. 
Research indicates that the mean level of creative cognition is not higher for the individuals with Bipolar I Disorder as compared to the those without the diagnosis.

The construct of narcissism is a personality trait that tends to be stable over time. Most of the time we think of narcissism as normal and adaptive. When the levels become elevated, they can become problematic (pathological narcissism). Narcissism is also associated with being low on the agreeableness trait in the five-factor model, so being disagreeable. There are two types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism (overt) and vulnerable narcissism (covert). Grandiose narcissism has characteristics like being dominant, having a sense of entitlement, being extroverted (so high on extraversion in the five-factor model), callousness, a sense of superiority, and a tendency to exploit other individuals (manipulative). Vulnerable narcissism has characteristics like being insecure, fearful, being sad, being introverted (low on extraversion in the five-factor model), having what's referred to as shame-proneness (tending to experience shame), being hypersensitive, angry, and aggressive. Sometimes when we talk about these two types of narcissism, the term narcissistic personality disorder gets mentioned, but narcissistic personality is different than grandiose or vulnerable narcissism. It's more similar to grandiose narcissism, but it's an official diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), so someone could be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, but could not be diagnosed with grandiose or vulnerable narcissism. Those are simply constructs measured on a continuum. Narcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, borderline, and histrionic. Sexual narcissism has a close relationship to narcissistic personality disorder and to grandiose narcissism in general. Sexual narcissism is a pattern of egocentric sexual interaction. Some of the characteristics we see associated with sexual narcissism would include a preoccupation with sex, placing a lot of importance on sexual activity, having sexual compulsivity (hypersexuality), having a casual attitude or orientation towards sexual interactions, having a sense of entitlement directly related to sexual activity, sexual manipulation, promiscuity, and an inflated sense of sexual skill or ability.

1772,Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotional Intelligence,2018-11-19,26097,1034,111,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between borderline personality disorder and emotional intelligence? I'm going to take a look at borderline personality disorder, then discuss emotional intelligence, and then look at the relationship between these two constructs. Borderline personality disorder is a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's a cluster B personality disorder, so this is the dramatic, erratic, and emotional cluster. That is the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. Nine symptom criteria are associated with borderline personality disorder: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment; an unstable intense relationship pattern; we see identity disturbance; impulsivity in at least two areas that could be self-damaging; suicidal behavior, gestures, and ideation; affective instability; chronic feelings of emptiness; inappropriate, intense anger; and paranoid ideation or dissociation. We also see there are other characteristics associated borderline personality disorder that are particularly important to recognize in light of this discussion of borderline personality disorder and emotional intelligence. These characteristics include an increased sensitivity to emotional stimuli, attending to experience emotions intensely (which is somewhat like what we see with the openness to experience trait on the five-factor model), and slow return to baseline mood after emotional stimulation.
Now taking a look at the construct of emotional intelligence, one of the difficulties in studying emotional intelligence is there is no single agreed upon definition. One definition we see that's fairly popular would be that emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, identify, express, access, understand emotions, and the ability to regulate emotions. Emotional is a fairly important construct when considering different aspects of mental health. Low levels of emotional intelligence have been associated with lower levels of self-esteem, and low levels of impulse control (which we would think would be particularly relevant when talking about borderline personality disorder). Low emotional intelligence is also associated higher levels of substance use, stress, suicidal ideation, aggressiveness, depression, and anxiety.

1773,What is Gaslighting and Where did the Term Gaslighting Originate?,2018-11-17,122339,4682,610,"This video answers the question: What is gaslighting and what is the origin of the term? Gaslighting is a term that refers to an individual trying to convince another individual that they've lost touch with reality or has mental health symptoms. Usually its conceptualized as a husband gaslighting a wife, but it doesn't have to be. It can be romantic partners and friends as well. It's a type of manipulation and it's usually thought of as cognitive, emotional, or psychological. The origin of the term actually is quite curious. There are a lot of different videos out there on YouTube and a lot different articles have been written about the origin, but there's a lot of mistakes that have been made in regard to where this term came from. Several of the origin stories for this term are based on a 1944 movie titled Gaslight and some are based on a 1938 play with the same name, but the way that gaslighting is described doesn't really line up too well with the play or the movie.  
Gaslighting is a deliberate manipulation usually between two people and usually in a fairly close relationship. Its conceptualized as long-term, gradual, and it can have the individual who's the victim of gaslighting having trouble determining what's true from what's false, questioning reality, questioning morality (right from wrong), and questioning sanity. This is done through lying dismissing one's perception or belief as invalid, isolation, and preventing access to information that we contradict what the gaslighter wants the individual to believe.
The goal of the manipulation strategy is to shake confidence, lower self-esteem, and make an individual dependent on another individual. 
There is a relationship between gaslighting and narcissism. Almost all the time when we see the term gaslighting, we see some reference to narcissism, pathological narcissism, grandiose or vulnerable narcissism, or narcissistic personality disorder. Manipulation is a key component of narcissism and specifically exploiting individuals interpersonally, but you could also make an argument it has a fairly close relationship to psychopathy. Psychopathy also has a manipulation component, although often times it's considered less personal than what we would see with narcissism. It's important to note here that anybody can engage in the activity of gaslighting. Somebody doesn't have to be psychopathic, sociopathic, they don't have to have antisocial personality disorder, or narcissistic personality disorder, or even be narcissistic.
It's just this term gaslighting has become associated with narcissism, it's not that it has to be committed by an individual who is narcissistic. Another important point here about gaslighting is it's not something you really find in the scientific literature. The term gaslighting really isn't a scientific term, it's more of a colloquial term.

1774,Why Does High Extraversion Predict Positive Emotions (Happiness)?,2018-11-15,3381,204,38,"The five-factor model of personality theory has five traits that explain personality. We can remember them through the acronym OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of the five traits has six facets under it, so we break down the traits into different constructs. One of those constructs for extraversion is called positive emotions, and sometimes it's referred to as cheerfulness. We see a fairly strong association between this facet and the trait level extraversion, meaning many people that are high in extraversion are high in this particular facet of positive emotions, although it is possible of course to have a low score on positive emotions and still have high scores on some of the other facets of extraversion. It's important to remember as well that positive emotions are not the same thing as an absence of negative emotions. Positive emotions are considered a facet of extraversion and negative emotions are a facet of neuroticism. Somebody can have high positive emotions and still have high negative emotions. 
Extraversion is a tendency to be gregarious, talkative, assertive, bold, friendly, enthusiastic, and excitement-seeking. Sometimes people who are high in extraversion are described as the “life of the party,” or as having a strong personality. There's also tendency to have positive emotions - to be cheerful.  We think of people with high extraversion scores as individuals who gain energy from social interaction. Low extraversion, which is sometimes referred to as introversion, has the tendency to be quiet, reserved, gaining energy from being alone, or sometimes gaining energy from being with just one other person. We also see the ability to deeply analyze information. There is also a tendency to have lower positive emotions.

1775,Five-Factor Model of Personality and Sexual Behavior,2018-11-14,65396,2256,138,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between the five-factor model of personality theory and sexual behavior?  The five-factor model of personality comprises five big personality traits that can be remembered through the acronym OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Each of the big traits has several characteristics that are associated with it. With openness to experience, we see characteristics like creativity, appreciating the arts, experiencing emotions intensely, being intellectually curious and adventurous. With conscientiousness, we see achievement-striving, cautiousness, being competent, following the rules, hardworking, and responsible behavior. Extraversion has traits like being gregarious, friendly, having positive emotions, excitement-seeking, being assertive, and being talkative. Agreeableness has trust, cooperation, modesty, being altruistic, being sympathetic, good-natured, and compliant. Neuroticism has traits like being anxious, depressed, hostile, feeling vulnerable, impulsivity, and the tendency to experience negative emotions. 
Some of the sexual behavior related to personality includes frequency of sexual activity, sexual infidelity, hypersexual behavior, and risky sexual behavior. Frequency of sexual intercourse is associated with extraversion positively, so higher frequency is associated with higher extraversion, and this includes casual and non-committed sex. We also see that sexual activity has a negative relationship with conscientiousness and agreeableness. A higher number of sexual partners over the lifetime was associated with higher extraversion and higher openness to experience. There is a negative relationship between sexual infidelity and conscientiousness and agreeableness. Hypersexual behavior was associated with higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness. Risky sexual behavior and this had a positive association with extraversion and a negative relationship with conscientiousness and agreeableness.

1776,Narcissism and Physical Abuse (Narcissistic Abuse),2018-11-12,41324,1065,208,"This video answers the question” What is the relationship between narcissism and physical abuse? When we talk about narcissism and any type of abuse we oftentimes think of the term “narcissistic abuse.” What this term means is in a relationship between a parent and a child or in a relationship between two adults, one individual could have traits of narcissism and that could contribute to abusive behavior. For example, “gaslighting” is a term we hear associated with this. This is when somebody with narcissistic traits tries to convince somebody else that they have mental disorder symptoms or distressing symptoms. The individual narcissism tries to make it appear as if that other person is the problem in the relationship. This term narcissistic abuse can refer to a relationship again between a parent or a child or two adults, but it's not an official term, rather it's more a term we see in the popular culture. It's not defined for use in mental health treatment and there's no type of syndrome, disorder, or condition listed in the DSM that is related to narcissistic abuse. This doesn't mean that narcissistic abuse can't lead to some sort of syndrome disorder or classification, it just means there's not an official classification for this and that's because the consequences of what we refer to as narcissistic abuse don't tend to cluster together. We don't tend to see the same symptoms over and over, although certain symptoms of course seem to be more common than others, for example: general distress, anxiety, worry, nervousness, codependency, and symptoms associated with emotional dysregulation. These would be fairly common, but again they don't cluster together in a clinically useful way or at least we haven't discovered that yet. Therefore, there's no disorder associated with narcissistic abuse, but that doesn't mean that some sort of classification isn't theoretically possible. We also see that the term narcissistic abuse doesn't come up in the research literature very often. That's because this isn't a specific term that's the focus of research, but that doesn't mean that this construct doesn't exist in the research at all. We study trait narcissism, pathological narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder, and we look for the effects that these behaviors have on other individuals. This would be similar to the construct of narcissistic abuse. Sometimes it's really just a matter of terminology that gets people confused when looking at what's involved with the popular culture and what's common in research. 
Narcissism is a personality trait and with it we see a sense of entitlement and arrogance. Narcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, so this is an official diagnosis that somebody can receive.
The two types of pathological narcissism are grandiose (overt) and vulnerable (covert). Similarities between these types include self-centeredness, intolerance, mistrust, excessive need for admiration, and the disregard of the needs of others. With overt narcissism we see a sense of entitlement, dominance, a sense of superiority, and a tendency to exploit other individuals. Covert narcissism is characterized by a tendency to experience shame (shame-proneness), sadness, insecurity, hypersensitivity, anger, and aggression.

Both of these disorders are Cluster B personality disorders - this is the dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster. With antisocial personality disorder there are seven symptom criteria: violating social norms (repeatedly engaging activities that would be grounds for arrest), deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability or aggression, disregarding one's own safety or the safety of others, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse. Borderline personality disorder has nine symptom criteria: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationship patterns (this is the love-hate cycle that we see with borderline personality disorder), difficulties with self-image (we refer to this as identity disturbance), impulsivity in at least two areas that could be self-damaging, suicidal behavior, gestures, and threats, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense and inappropriate anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation.
The etiology for Cluster B personality disorders, and specifically for antisocial and borderline personality disorders, includes negative life events like trauma and poor parenting. Both disorders tend to have a marked increase in severity and adolescence, then they tend to be the same or decline a little bit in young adulthood. There is a plateau or decreasing symptoms in late middle age.

1778,What is the Downside of Socially Desirable Personality Characteristics?,2018-11-08,11114,657,92,"This video answers the question: What is the downside of having socially desirable personality characteristics? 
I will be looking at this from the perspective of the five-factor model (FFM) and the personality-related difficulties at the extremes of personality traits. We know the five-factor model can predict certain types of difficulties. Taking a look at the five-factor model, we see the acronym OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. It's important to understand what profile is considered socially desirable versus undesirable. Typically, the socially desirable profile would be high scores and openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness, and a low score in neuroticism. Of course, that means the socially undesirable profile would be a low score in openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and a high score in neuroticism. A lot of the research literature really pays attention to that socially undesirable personality profile and there's not a lot of attention given to the extreme scores moving in the socially desirable direction. This is interesting because both the high and low poles of each of the traits are associated with difficulties. The concern here is that mental health clinicians may be missing a lot of potential difficulties by ignoring certain scores on personality traits. To answer this question about the downside of socially desirable traits, I'll really be looking at the downside of both socially desirable and socially undesirable traits. 
Low openness to experience: difficulty adjusting to change an indifference toward the feelings and thoughts of other people, having difficulty thinking creatively, and having a lack of curiosity and imagination
High openness to experience: being excessively detached from the conventions of society, being excessively imaginative, being lost in one's own internal world, and being in trouble with the law
Low in conscientiousness: difficulties with impulse control, difficulty achieving goals, and being easily distracted
High conscientiousness: working too hard, difficulty giving up control, being stringent, a preoccupation with rules, order, schedules, and organization, difficulty making decisions quickly, and perfectionism 
Low extraversion: anhedonia and social withdrawal 
High extraversion: being overly controlling, having intense attachments, excessive risk-taking, being flaunting, being loquacious 
Low agreeableness: arrogance, manipulativeness, and being argumentative
High agreeableness: self-denigration, being dependent, gullible, deferential, feeling ineffective, and feeling useless
High neuroticism: social inhibition, low self-esteem, and difficulty controlling emotions
Low neuroticism: risk-taking, being emotionless, and acting out against others in society

1779,Does Watching Television Cause Narcissism?,2018-11-07,2079,174,26,"This video answers the question: Does watching television cause narcissism? Narcissism has been on the rise for many years and their concerns about what might be causing this trend. Television viewing in particular has been implicated as a possible cause of narcissism. Narcissism refers to a trait that's measured on a continuum. Narcissistic personality disorder is an official disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and can only be diagnosed by a licensed and qualified mental health clinician. Narcissistic personality disorder is usually conceptualized as an extreme level of grandiose narcissistic traits. The symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder include a grandiose sense of self-importance, exaggerated fantasies of success and power, believing oneself to be special or unique, requiring excessive admiration, having a sense of entitlement, exploiting people interpersonally, lacking empathy, having envy for other people in believing other people are envying them, and arrogance. The viewing of certain television genres has been linked with increased levels of narcissism. Specifically, reality TV, sports, suspense/thriller/horror, and political talk shows have the strongest positive association with narcissism. This means that watching these genres was associated with a higher level of narcissism. Only one genre, the news, had a negative relationship with narcissism. Other television genres don't appear to have any relationship to narcissism. This relationship between narcissism and television represents a correlation and not necessarily indicative of a causative relationship. It could very well be that individuals who have narcissism are attracted to certain genres of television, or some unknown variable could explain this relationship.

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by several symptoms: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment; intense, unstable relationship style (idealization-devaluation cycle); identity disturbance; impulsivity; suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, and ideation; affective instability; chronic feelings of emptiness; intense, inappropriate anger; and paranoid ideation.
Some of those symptoms are similar to what is often observed with depression, like recurrent thoughts of death, feelings of worthlessness and a feeling of emptiness. There are similarities with bipolar disorder, like engaging activities that have a high probability of painful consequences.
Borderline personality disorder has high co-occurrence with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Depending on what research you look at the co-occurrence rate is anywhere from 4% on the low end to 48% on the high end. 
We know that it is difficult sometimes to differentiate borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. For example, research literature indicates that both borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder are characterized by heightened reactivity and instability of negative emotions. To differentiate the disorders, we can measure variability in three different ways. One way is emotional instability. This is abrupt variability in emotional state. The next is emotional reactivity. This is a specific type of emotional instability, one that's linked to a specific psychosocial event. The last construct would be emotional inertia. This is the persistence of an emotional expression. We could think about this construct as having little or no variability, so the emotion stays the same over time. Sometimes in clinical work this is referred to as “getting stuck.” The same emotion persists for a long time and somebody has difficulty moving out of that emotional state. These three ways of looking at variability of emotion (emotional instability, emotional reactivity, and emotional inertia) can be measured across a number of emotions like irritable, angry, guilty, ashamed, happy, and excited.
Individuals with borderline personality disorder tend to experience heightened instability and interpersonal reactivity of negative emotions. Also, we see increased instability, increased interpersonal reactivity, and increased inertia around guilt and shame.

1781,"Social Anxiety Disorder and Cluster A Personality Disorders (Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal)",2018-11-03,11798,459,40,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between social anxiety disorder and the Cluster A personality disorders? The Cluster A personality disorders include paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders. When we talk about social anxiety disorder, we're talking about a disorder where we see fear and anxiety in social situations. This can be in performance situations only like public speaking or in a variety of situations. The fear we often see associated with social anxiety disorder is a fear of negative evaluation. We also see with social anxiety disorder, there would be clinically significant distress or clinically significant impairment. The Cluster A personality disorders are in the odd, eccentric cluster as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by distrust and suspiciousness of others and believing that others have a malevolent motive. Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotions. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by social and interpersonal deficits, discomfort with close relationships, and cognitive and perceptual distortions and eccentricities. One theory about the Cluster A personality disorders is they have a relationship to schizophrenia. Schizophrenia may be on a continuum and Cluster A may be a position on that continuum.",Nov,Dr. Todd Grande
1782,What Causes Alexithymia?,2018-11-01,65287,2296,110,"This video answers the question: What causes alexithymia? Alexithymia is a construct or a condition, but it's not a mental disorder. It won't be found, for example, in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Alexithymia really has three distinct components to it. The first is a difficulty identifying emotions and what we commonly see here is difficulty distinguishing between bodily sensations and feelings. The second component is a difficulty describing feelings, so this would be a difficulty in expressing or communicating an emotional state to someone else. The third component of alexithymia would be an externally-oriented cognitive style. What this means is that there would be a low level of introspection so if somebody would tend to focus on external facts and not on feelings. We could think of this as concrete versus abstract. Someone with alexithymia would tend to think in concrete terms and not abstract terms. We could think of this in terms of the five-factor model as having some similarity to low openness to experience, specifically low imagination and low levels of fantasy. Another interesting point here with this third aspect of alexithymia is that this also tends to affect dreams. We also see increased levels of impulsivity increased levels of aggression. There is comorbidity with a number of other mental disorders. We see comorbidity with all of the Cluster B personality disorders except for histrionic personality disorder, so this would include narcissistic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorder. We also see comorbidity with substance use disorder, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Some research has indicated that alexithymia actually predicts posttraumatic stress disorder. Alexithymia is thought of as being highly stable, it's usually conceptualized as a personality trait and, of course, personality disorders are conceptualized as an extreme manifestation of certain personality traits. The theory in terms of the etiology of alexithymia is that child maltreatment leads to alexithymia and alexithymia tends to contribute in some ways to certain mental health symptoms. There are five types of child maltreatment: there's emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, physical neglect, and sexual abuse. Of these five types, alexithymia has been most closely linked to emotional neglect and emotional abuse and really hasn't been linked very strongly at all to the other types of child maltreatment.

1783,"Co-occurring Disorders, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Criminal Offending",2018-10-31,7947,227,21,"This video answers the question: What's the relationship between co-occurring disorders, antisocial personality, and criminal offending. A co-occurring disorder is when there's a presentation that has both, a substance use disorder and a mental disorder. Now, there can be several substance use disorders and several mental disorders, but at least one of each of those categories has to be in the presentation for it to qualify as a co-occurring disorder. We know that co-occurring disorders are fairly common with major mood disorders and we also know that co-occurring disorders are fairly common involving personality disorders, including antisocial personality. Now, criminal offending has been linked to co-occurring disorders. We know that the prevalence of co-occurring disorders in prison populations and forensic populations is somewhere between 70 and 80%. We also know there's an association between co-occurring disorders and violence increased likelihood of being incarcerated and increased criminal recidivism. Now, the association between mental disorders in general and violence is actually fairly low. It's a weak association, we know that for specific mental disorders there is a higher risk of violence but, we also know that when substance use disorder is combined with mental disorders that increases the risk of violence quite a bit. Now why does this occur? Well, there are many theories about substance use disorders and violence. One is that the use of substances including other effects like intoxication and withdrawal may exacerbate mental health symptoms. Also, we know that intoxication is a major risk factor for violence. Another theory is that disinhibition plays a part. With substance use there's oftentimes increased disinhibition so, this would be an increase in impulsive behaviors and we know that this has a link to criminal offending, specifically violent offending. Can we quantify this risk of violence with mental disorders? Actually, the prevalence of violent behavior in individuals without any mental disorder is just over 2%. With substance use disorders alone it's just under 20%, and with co-occurring disorders it's around 22%. So, quite a large difference between the without mental disorder group and the substance use disorder and co-occurring disorder group. Now again, this is really just an association between these categories and violence. It doesn't mean that there's causality. There may be other factors that cause both the offending and the disorders. Now specifically talking about co-occurring disorder that involves antisocial personality disorder, we know that there are particular risks with this combination but, first I'll briefly go over antisocial personality disorder. With antisocial personality disorder we see seven symptoms in the symptom criteria: repeatedly violating society's norms so, engaging a behavior that could be grounds for arrest, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability and aggression, a disregard for the safety of self and others, being irresponsible, and a lack of remorse. Now, we know that when we look at co-occurring disorders together with antisocial personality this is linked to more offending than just co-occurring disorders alone. Also, we know the combination of co-occurring disorder and antisocial personality is more prevalent than substance use disorder with any other mental disorder, including any other personality disorder.

1784,"Narcissistic Personality Disorder and the ""Trail of Destruction""",2018-10-29,101544,3430,408,"This video answers the question: What is the string of interpersonal relationship difficulties that we tend to see associated with narcissistic personality disorder. This series of difficulties and relationships associated with narcissistic personality disorder (sometimes we hear this term “trail destruction”) is that individuals with this disorder as well as several other disorders, are more likely to have a number of interpersonal relational difficulties. This term “trail of destruction” is used with NPD, but also borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorders, and a variety of other disorders. This so called “trail of destruction” isn't limited to just the relational problems, although we do see a number of failed, strained, and dysfunctional relationships. We also see other types of problems: rejections from individuals, rejections in social situations (like not being via the parties or not being invited to social media groups), rejections with employment (like being fired), and rejections within the family. There's this long series of rejections, failures, and conflicts. Narcissistic personality disorder is a diagnosis in the DSM, but also here in this video I'm going to be talking about NPD as it relates to pathological narcissism. These are two different constructs. One way to express it simply would be that narcissistic personality disorder is largely based on behaviors and mostly covers grandiose narcissism and pathological narcissism is more of a comprehensive view of narcissism, as it includes vulnerable narcissism.",Oct,Dr. Todd Grande

1786,Maternal Psychological Control and Borderline Personality Disorder,2018-10-26,45518,1406,152,"This video answers the questions: Does the psychologically controlling behavior of a mother with borderline personality disorder contribute to symptoms in their children? First, I'm going to start with what borderline personality disorder is. Take a look at this construct of psychological control and then look at the relationship borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. This is the dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster. In the definition of borderline personality disorder we see nine symptom criteria. We have frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, a pattern of unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in at least two areas that could be self -damaging, suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, affective instability, a chronic feeling of emptiness, intense inappropriate anger, or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. There are a number of theories about what causes borderline personality, and we know that part of the etiology that causes a disorder for borderline personality disorder is genetic, and another part is environmental. And, we look at the environmental part, there are a lot of theories about how neglect, abuse, and other adverse childhood experiences may contribute to the development of the disorder. So, it makes sense that there would be this theory that psychological control could lead to borderline personality disorder, or borderline traits. Let's take a look at the concept of psychological control. This is different than behavioral control. Psychological control inhibits, or intrude on, the development of adolescent independence, so it interferes in a key step of development. Psychological control comprises a number of different potential behaviors including negating expressed emotions. So, this is when a parent invalidates the emotions of an adolescent, interrupting or talking over, so really a disturbance in, verbal communication. We see shaming, placing the burden of parental needs on the adolescents, so making the adolescent responsible to meet parental needs. There could be blaming, accusing, bringing up past mistakes, so not letting errors go from the past, emotional inconsistency, and physically demonstrating disapproval, like eye rolling or turning away. So, a lot of different behaviors and relational characteristics that could interfere, in theory, with identity formation. That's one of the reasons we believe that psychological control can cause problems, including mental health problems, because of this identity formation component. Now specifically borderline personality we know that identity disturbance is actually one of the symptom criterion. We also believe that psychological control creates an in validating environment also thought to lead to borderline personality disorder, and we think it has an association with being emotionally reactive. If you look at those different characteristics of psychological control it's easy to see this connection. The research indicates a positive correlation between maternal psychological control and maternal borderline features.  Affective instability in mothers with borderline personality disorder appears to mediate the relationship between maternal psychological control and adolescent affective instability.

1787,"Psychopathic Traits, Police, & Heroism (Successul Psychopathy)",2018-10-24,21146,861,71,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between heroism and psychopathy? First let's start with the concept of psychopathy. Psychopathy is really a paradox in terms of the traits that are encompassed in the definition. Oftentimes we see psychopathy divided into two factors, factor 1 and factor 2 traits. There's this two-factor model and sometimes we also see three and four factor models of psychopathy. Some of the traits we see associated with psychopathy would include superficial charm, low anxiety, grandiosity, antisocial behavior, low levels of empathy, or lack of empathy, impulsivity, irresponsibility, and sensation-seeking. Now we can think about these two factors I mentioned before as interpersonal/emotional as one and lifestyle-behavioral as the other. With factor 1 we see traits like that superficial charm and grandiosity and with factor 2, we see antisocial behaviors, impulsivity, irresponsibility, and sensation-seeking. Generally, we think of factor 1 as primary psychopathy and factor 2 as secondary psychopathy. I talk about these constructs in a prior video. Now we can also look at psychopathy from a slightly different angle by using an instrument that's very popular to measure psychopathy: Psychopathic Personality Inventory Revised. Here we see dimensions like dominance like physical fearlessness, stress, immunity, and that superficial charm (this is usually considered adaptive). We also see self-centered impulsivity. This has the antisocial traits under it and coldheartedness, which would be lack of empathy, lack of guilt, and lack of attachment to other people. This brings me to the idea of successful psychopathy. This is a theory on the study of psychopathy and it says that some of the traits associated with success really align with some of the traits we see with psychopathy like narcissism, fearlessness, and sensation-seeking. We know from studies on leadership for example that there are both pros and cons associated with psychopathic traits. On the positive side we see strategic thinking, better communication skills, and high levels of conscientiousness. On the negative side we see individuals who are poor team players and have dysfunctional management styles. With the theory of successful psychopathy in mind we take a look at the particular studies here related to psychopathy and heroism. What were the results from these studies? When they compared first responders and a number of heroic acts to a control group they found that both heroism and altruism were positively associated with narcissism, boldness, and sensation-seeking but also with interpersonal workplace deviance and workplace conduct problems. So what we really see here from this study is that there's a theory that antisocial and prosocial behaviors are opposite poles of the same dimension. But that doesn't seem to be the case. These results indicate that antisocial and prosocial behaviors relate in a more complex way. Now a word of caution about these results, and this was made clear in both of these studies, this doesn't mean that first responders have psychopathy. That's not what's indicated by these results. It means that there are certain psychopathic traits that were more elevated in first responders. Another important point when interpreting the results of these studies is the psychopathy is complex and dimensional. These are several traits that load together on this construct of psychopathy but together they represent a paradox. We see adaptive traits and maladaptive traits. So somebody really isn't psychopathic or not psychopathic, rather there are particular levels on certain traits.

1788,The Dissociative Identity Disorder Controversy (Trauma vs. Iatrogenic),2018-10-22,108842,3527,669,"This video answers questions about the controversy around a mental disorder named dissociative identity disorder (DID). Dissociative identity disorder is an official mental disorder in the DSM and the criteria for DID are listed there. We see a disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states (in some cultures these distinct personality states may be referred to as possession), we see a marked discontinuity of self and alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and sensory motor functions. These different personality states may be observed by other individuals and reported to the individual who has this disorder. We also see recurrent gaps in recall of everyday events, personal information, or traumatic events. These gaps in recall can't be attributed to normal forgetfulness. There must be clinically significant distress or impairment and it cannot be a normal part of cultural or religious practices, substance use, or a medical condition. The prevalence of dissociative identity disorder is thought to be between 1 and 1.6% of the general population. We know that this particular disorder is associated with a great deal of comorbidity, meaning it tends to co-occur with other mental disorders like borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, sleep disorders, conversion disorder, and substance use disorder. Also, self-harm behaviors and suicidal behaviors have been associated with dissociative identity disorder.

1789,Does the Full Moon Affect Human Behavior?,2018-10-19,345378,10244,345,"This video answers the question: Can a full moon affect human behavior? This is a theory that I've heard many times and there's a lot of different behaviors that people attribute to full moons. It's believed that 80% of nurses, 70% of mental health clinicians, and 50% of the general public believe that the full moon affects human behavior and there are a lot of different areas that this belief says can be affected by a full moon. For example, increasing psychiatric hospital admissions, increasing crime, including violent crime, increasing the risk of unstable behavior or mood dysphoria, increasing the number of seizures that occur, and the number of traffic accidents. To understand this theory about the moon, we have to understand a little bit about the moon's orbit and about gravitation. First with gravitation, the moon exerts gravitational force on everything else in the universe, technically, but everything else on the planet including human beings and all the objects on the planet. The most noticeable impact of this gravitational force is the moon's effect on the oceans and other large bodies of water. We know for instance that the moon has an impact on tides. the way the theory goes is that if the moon is exerting gravitational force on the oceans, which are of course mostly water, then it's exerting gravitational force on people in some special way because human beings are mostly water (about 80% water).  Next, we need to take a look at the moon's orbit and how it does or doesn't line up with the phases of the moon. A full moon ad a new moon are phases of the Moon. They don't have a relationship with the distance between the moon and the earth. The moon orbits the earth in an elliptical pattern and when the moon's closest to the earth that's called perigee and when the moon is farthest away it’s called apogee. The phases of the moon, like full moon and new moon, do not correspond with the perigee or the apogee, so when the moon is exerting the most gravitational force on a person, that's not necessarily related to a phase of the moon. Another important part here is to understand how much gravitational force the moon is actually exerting our person. To understand this, we have to understand the concept of a Newton. A Newton is a measure of force and it's the amount of force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass one meter per second per second, so it's a very small amount of force. If we think about what it feels like on a person on earth, one Newton would be about .22 pounds, so very light amount of force. Now the amount of force the earth exerts on the average human being is around 950 Newton's. The amount of force that the moon exerts on human being is about .004 Newtons. There is some evidence that there is a relationship between the full moon and some animal behavior. In terms of human beings there is evidence that a full moon can have a very small effect on sleep (less than 1% the amount that so many sleeps would be subject to change based on a full moon). 
If the full moon is really not affecting human behavior, which it doesn't appear to be in any meaningful way, why do so many people believe that the full moon of affects behavior. Well for one thing, the idea that the full moon affects human behavior goes back a long way. The term “lunacy” comes from a Latin word for the moon, so this belief that unstable behavior is associated with the moon goes back many years. When you have a tradition like this, when you have a belief that goes back a long way, by default most people will of course believe it until they see evidence to the contrary. This is where a problem comes in. First of all, we tend to look at events more than nonevents. It's just a condition of human behavior. If something unusual happens we're going to notice that if it happens to coincide with a full moon. We're going to remember that coincidence more than we remember a nonevent or even an event happening when there's not a full moon. There's a bit of memory bias at work. When we believe something as we would in the case of the full moon, because this belief has been around a long time, we tend to look at evidence that confirms our belief. We are going to look at things that happen during a full moon and tend to attribute those behaviors to the full moon, instead of other more likely causes.",Oct,Dr. Todd Grande
1790,Rejection and Rage with Borderline Personality Disorder,2018-10-17,124240,4068,157,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between rejection sensitivity, rage and borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), which is the emotional, erratic, and dramatic cluster. It's the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. The symptom criteria include: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, an unstable relationship pattern (sometimes this is called the love-hate cycle), identity disturbance, impulsivity in at least two areas that could be self-damaging, suicidal behaviors, affective instability, a chronic feeling of emptiness, inappropriate, intense anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation.  It's important to note here of course that only five of these symptoms need to be present for a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Only a licensed and qualified clinician can make a diagnosis. There are presentations of borderline personality order that don't involve inappropriate, intense anger. In my experience these are not as common as presentations that do involve anger, but it is still important to recognize that we see with borderline personality disorder, not all presentations are similar. When the symptom criterion of anger is met in borderline personality disorder, we see this anger has a certain characteristic to it a lot of times. This particular type of anger is sometimes referred to as borderline rage. This is because it's not only intense and inappropriate, but there's an uncontrolled feeling to this particular type of anger, and it causes a lot of problems for individuals of borderline personality disorder. We see evidence of this in the research. This anger or rage can disrupt relationships including romantic relationships, friendships, relationships at work, and even the therapeutic relationship. We also see that this anger or rage is associated with violence and it predicts early termination of treatment on the part of the individual with borderline personality disorder. Individuals who have this rage are more likely to drop out of therapy. We also see an increased risk for self-harm and suicidal behavior associated with borderline rage. Research shows a strong association between rejection sensitivity and rage. It's important when looking at the results to here that we keep in mind that rejection sensitivity isn't the only thing that explains rage in borderline personality disorder, but it does appear to be a significant factor.

1791,Dark Traits vs. Vulnerable Dark Traits (Dark Triad vs. Vulnerable Dark Triad),2018-10-15,43035,1575,90,"This video answers the question: What is the difference between the dark traits and the vulnerable dark traits. The dark traits and the vulnerable dark traits are traits that are connected to criminality and, in theory, they are differentially connected to criminality. The dark traits predict certain types of criminal activities and the vulnerable dark traits predict other types of criminal activities. The topic of dark traits and vulnerable dark traits is a little confusing because of the term triad. A lot of times we hear this we hear the “dark triad” and the “vulnerable dark triad,” but just like the traits, there's no single agreed upon definition for the dark triad or vulnerable dark triad. One popular definition of the dark triad would be that there's three traits: psychopathy, narcissism, and machiavellianism. This particular theory, to some extent, has fallen out of favor because machiavellianism doesn't appear to be a distinct construct. I talked about this in a prior video about the dark triad. Another conceptualization has interpersonal and affective psychopathic traits along with grandiose narcissism. The vulnerable dark triad comprises lifestyle psychopathic traits, vulnerable narcissism, and borderline personality traits. 
Psychopathy has two factors: factor 1 and factor 2. Each of these factors has two facets. Factor 1 psychopathy is interpersonal and affective. On the interpersonal side we see traits like superficial charm, grandiosity, pathological lying, and being manipulative. On the affective side we see traits like lack of remorse, lack of empathy, and callousness. Factor 1 is associated with a low level of agreeableness and a high level of extraversion on the five-factor model. Factor 2 is referred to as the social deviance factor and again it has two facets: lifestyle and antisocial. The lifestyle facet has characteristics like impulsivity and irresponsibility. The antisocial facet has characteristics like poor behavioral controls and criminal versatility. Factor 2 is associated with low level of conscientiousness, low level of extraversion, and a high level of neuroticism. Narcissism can be divided into two factors: grandiose (sometimes referred to as overt), and vulnerable (sometimes referred to as covert or hypersensitive). Grandiose narcissism has characteristics like arrogance, a sense of entitlement, and being socially bold. It's associated with a high level of extraversion. Vulnerable narcissism has characteristics like being resentful, hyper sensitive, having social insecurity, being defensive, and being avoidant. It's associated with a low level of extraversion. Borderline personality disorder has a variety of symptoms including a fear of abandonment, identity disturbance, impulsivity, anger, a chronic feeling of emptiness, and a few other characteristics. We can see that psychopathy, narcissism, and borderline personality traits can have negative consequences. There are a number of unpleasant emotions and behaviors associated with these different constructs.

1792,What is the Relationship between Borderline Personality Disorder and Shame/Guilt?,2018-10-12,63914,2218,152,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between borderline personality disorder and shame and guilt. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). That is the dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster. There are nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder: 1) frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, 2) an unstable, intense relationship pattern - sometimes we think of this as an idealization devaluation cycle, 3) identity disturbance, 4) impulsivity in at least two areas that would be self-damaging, 5) recurrent suicidal behavior, like gestures, attempts, and threats, 6) affective instability, 7) chronic feelings of emptiness, 8) intense and appropriate anger (this one's particularly important when we talk about shame and guilt) and, 9) paranoid ideation and dissociation. Five symptom criteria are required for a diagnosis, which can only be made by a licensed and qualified clinician. Shame and guilt are not specifically mentioned anywhere in the symptom criteria, but we know they are features associated with borderline personality disorder. This idea of being more likely to experience shame is referred to as shame proneness and there's a lot of research that shows that borderline personality disorder has this component. For example, we see with borderline personality disorder an increased level of shame when compared to other disorders that have an affective instability component. We also see that the effect of shame lasts longer in borderline personality disorder than we see with other negative effects. This shame component is really considered a cornerstone borderline personality disorder. We also know that guilt has a relationship with borderline personality disorder. We usually think of this relationship as being less guilt, so we see more shame but less guilt.
There is a difference between shame and guilt. Both shame and guilt are self-directed negative emotions. With shame, there's this belief that individual has that they are bad, are not good enough, or have a defect or a deficit. Guilt is when someone believes their behaviors are bad. Guilt is more logical than shame, and it's actually more useful than shame in a lot of ways. We generally view shame as destructive. Shame has been associated with increased feelings of anger, increased aggression, and an increased probability of externalizing blame. All three of those characteristics have an association with borderline personality disorder. We also see with increased levels of shame an increased probability of ruminating about experiences that led to the anger in the first place, whether those experiences would have normally resulted in anger or not. Guilt is associated with less anger and less aggression. This really gives us the idea that in general, shame is bad and unhelpful and guilt is good and helpful. Of course, that's not always true. We see with other mental disorders, like major depressive disorder for example, where there's oftentimes inappropriate and unhelpful levels of guilt. It is a generalization to say that shame is unhelpful and guilt is helpful, it's not necessarily appropriate or accurate for every situation.

1793,Bipolar Disorder and Aggression,2018-10-10,120670,3309,136,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between bipolar disorder and aggression? To understand bipolar disorder, it’s first important understand that there are two types of bipolar disorder: Bipolar I and Bipolar II. Sometimes it can be difficult to differentiate between Bipolar I Disorder and Bipolar II Disorder and that's mostly because of the way that mania presents. Mania is the primary difference between these two disorders. A diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder requires that at some point there was a manic episode. Technically speaking, depression is not required for Bipolar I Disorder, but oftentimes we see major depressive episodes. Bipolar II Disorder has at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode. You could think of major depressive disorder as unipolar depression and, of course, Bipolar Disorder has two poles. Sometimes we hear that Bipolar II Disorder is really a less severe variant of Bipolar I Disorder, but the evidence really doesn't support that theory. Both types of bipolar disorder are serious disorders that necessitate treatment.
In the research literature, Bipolar Disorder has been linked to aggression. If we look specifically at individuals with Bipolar Disorder who are inpatient (who are hospitalized), we see that they tend to demonstrate significantly more aggressive behavior than individuals that do not have Bipolar Disorder. We also see that in inpatient settings, physical assault is equally prevalent among Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Substance Use Disorders. This link between aggression and Bipolar Disorder is established and it is a real problem in terms of treating the disorder and keeping clients safe. Violence is a separate construct than aggression, although there is some overlap. Violence that has been associated with Bipolar Disorder is actually largely explained by comorbid Substance Use Disorders. The substance use component of that comorbid presentation is really what accounts for the violent component. Sometimes we hear this myth that individuals with Bipolar Disorder are more prone to violence and that's not really the case. This link between Bipolar Disorder and aggression does not mean that individuals with Bipolar Disorder have a tendency to engage in more severe violent behaviors.

Here is a description of psychopathy, sociopathy, and antisocial personality disorder based on what we know from the research literature:
Antisocial Personality Disorder is a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's a Cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders. Antisocial personality disorder affects about 3% of the population, but depending on what literature you look at, it may affect up to 80% of the population in correctional settings. We see the definition of antisocial personality is broken to a few different criteria: a tendency to violate social norms (committing actions that could be grounds for arrest), deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability or aggression, a disregard for the safety of others, irresponsibility, and a lack of remorse. In order for somebody diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder they must be at least 18 years of age. Conduct disorder symptoms must have been present before the age of 15, so just as is the case with all personality disorders, there is no such thing as late onset antisocial personality disorder. The antisocial behavior cannot occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Moving on to the construct of psychopathy, we see here that psychopathy is an area that's studied, it's not a mental disorder. Someone can't really be diagnosed as having psychopathy or not, in a technical sense. Psychopathy affects about 1% of the population. In forensic settings about 16 percent of males are affected and about 7 percent of females are affected. Psychopathy can be divided into two factors and each of those factors can be divided into two facets. Factor one alone is sometimes referred to as psychopathy. Factor 2 is sometimes referred to as sociopathy. With psychopathy we have two factors and a total of four facets. Factor one is interpersonal/affective and factor two is referred to as social deviance. With the interpersonal facet we see certain characteristics like superficial charm, grandiosity, pathological lying, and a tendency to be manipulative. With the affective facet, we see a lack of remorse and shallow effect, callousness, lack of empathy. and a failure to accept responsibility. Moving to factor two (sociopathy) we see need for stimulation, parasitic lifestyle, lack of realistic long-term goals, impulsivity, irresponsibility, poor behavioral controls, early behavioral problems, juvenile delinquency, a revocation of conditional release, and criminal versatility.",Oct,Dr. Todd Grande
1795,Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation,2018-10-08,37303,1106,32,"This video answers the question: Can I explain the relationship between negative and positive emotions and borderline personality disorder? First, let's take a look at the borderline personality disorder. It is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This emotional, erratic, and dramatic cluster. It's in the same cluster as narcissistic, antisocial, and histrionic personality disorders. There are nine symptom criteria listed in the DSM for borderline personality disorder: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable pattern of relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in at least two areas where there's self damage, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. It's not surprising when looking at the definition of borderline personality disorder that there's some relationship to emotional reactivity. We know from prior research that there are a number of theories about how emotional regulation relates to borderline personality disorder. Under one theory, we see that borderline personality disorder is really a dysfunction of both positive and negative emotions and with this theory we would see a dampened emotional response to both positive and negative stimuli. Another similar theory is that both positive and negative emotions are involved, but it's mostly an expression of negative emotions and there's high variability with positive emotions, so on the positive emotion side we see large swings, but we see consistently negative emotions. A third theory is that borderline personality disorder is mostly a disorder involving negative emotions and it's really not any different in terms of positive emotions. We also see in studies of borderline personality disorder relating to the accuracy of recognizing facial expressions with individuals of borderline personality disorder, they tend to have low accuracy when looking at negative facial expressions and their accuracy is in the normal range for positive facial expressions. They tend to have higher emotional reactivity in response to negative emotions and the emotional reactivity isn't really any different for positive emotions. The results of the particular study reviewed here indicated that there was a strong association between borderline personality disorder symptoms and negative emotions, but only small deficits in positive emotions were observed. These findings were consistent across borderline personality disorder symptoms when looking at frequency, duration, and severity.

1796,Is Histrionic Personality Disorder Dead?,2018-10-05,11702,412,72,"This video answers the question: Is Histrionic Personality Disorder dead? Recently, Histrionic Personality Disorder has not been studied much in the research literature. It is listed in the DSM-5, but it was not listed in the alternative model of personality disorders. Some theorize that Histrionic Personality Disorder has excessive overlap with Borderline Personality Disorder. Discussions about deleting Histrionic Personality Disorder from the next DSM have not been met with much resistance. Histrionic Personality Disorder does not usually cause as much distress or impairment as other personality disorders, which has contributed to the theory that Histrionic Personality Disorder should no longer be considered a mental disorder. Histrionic Personality Disorder may not be a useful classification, even though the symptoms in contains are observed in clinical settings.
Histrionic Personality Disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms including wanting to be the center of attention, sexually seductive behavior, rapidly shifting and shallow emotions, an effort to gain attention through physical appearance, impressionistic speech pattern, self-dramatizing, exaggerated emotional expressions, theatrical, easily influenced, and believe relationships are more intimate than they really are. Individuals with Histrionic Personality Disorder tend to struggle with relationships and sometimes seek treatment from depressive symptoms from losing relationships. The prevalence of Histrionic Personality Disorder is about 2%. Histrionic Personality Disorder is highly comorbid with Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and depressive disorders, somatic symptom disorder, and conversion disorder.",Oct,Dr. Todd Grande
1797,Borderline Personality Disorder and Meaning in Life,2018-10-03,23995,1007,61,"This video answers the question: What is the association between the meaning in life and borderline personality disorder? When we talk about borderline personality disorder, we're talking about a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Meaning in life refers to a sense of purpose that individuals develop. There is a belief that these two constructs are related. First let’s take a look at borderline personality disorder. As I mentioned, this is a cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the general population is about 1% and there are a lot of studies with a lot of different prevalence figures, but overall it seems like 1% is reasonable in terms of a guess. In terms of gender prevalence, here we're not really sure. There are research studies that indicate that the prevalence is about equal between the genders, so roughly the same number of men are affected as women, but most studies indicate that more females would have borderline personality disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), we see nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder and five have to be met for a diagnosis. The symptom criteria include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in two areas that are potentially self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. It's estimated that about 10% of individuals with borderline personality disorder will complete suicide and about 60 to 80% of individuals with this disorder will have non-suicidal self-injury at some point in their life. 
The meaning in life is a philosophy that an individual adopts regarding their sense of purpose. This is different than an overarching existential construct of the meaning of life, although certainly there is an overlap here. Meaning in life is very specific to a person and we see that this term meaning in life also has a number of alternate terms: sense of purpose, goal-directedness, self-actualization, and authentic living. We know that a higher level of meaning in life is protective factor, therefore it reduces but doesn't eliminate the risk of suicide. It's also associated with a positive view of life, increased coping skills, and increased life satisfaction. A lower level of meaning in life has been associated with substance use, depression, suicide, hopelessness, emotional dysregulation, antisocial behavior, hostility, aggression, and it's also been associated with having an invalidating environment.

The video in which she was featured has become popular, and some worry about the effect on those suffering with antisocial personality disorder, sociopathic traits, or psychopathic traits. This video’s only purpose and focus is to clarify the nature of these constructs.
Here is a description of the constructs based on what we know from the research literature:
Antisocial Personality Disorder is a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's a Cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders.

1799,"Do Negative Life Experiences Cause Avoidant, Dependent & Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorders?",2018-10-01,26551,1044,37,"This video answers the question: How do negative life experiences contribute to the development of Cluster C personality disorders. When we talk about Cluster C personality disorders, we're talking about three specific personality disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and the manual divides up personality disorders into three clusters Clusters A, B, and C. Cluster C contains avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Now there are a number of theories about what could cause these personality disorders and it's important when we talk about causation though, to start with this idea of causation versus association. A lot of times with mental disorders, including personality disorders, what we're really talking about is some sort of association that's been identified between some sort of construct like a genetic or environmental construct and the development of a disorder. Association and correlation are different than causation. Now when we talk about Cluster C personality disorders and personalities in general, we know that genetics appear to play a part but we don't know the exact contribution. A lot of times for a number of personality disorders, it's speculated that the contribution of genetics is around 50% - 60%, but really we're not sure. In looking at negative life experiences, I'm looking more at the environmental as opposed to genetic. In terms of environmental causes, there are a number of theories that have been proposed over the years. Attachment theorists focus on early relationship quality. Psychodynamic theorists focus on profound dysfunction and conflicts, again in early life. Cognitive theorists focus on maladaptive schemas, which are distorted views about how people see themselves others in the world. All three of these schools of thought though share this one part in common: whatever happened that leads to personality disorders (specifically Cluster C personality disorders) tends to occur early and we conceptualize the negative life experience almost all the time we're talking about childhood experiences. Sometimes the term negative life experience is used interchangeably with negative life event and I don't really see a problem with this normally. If we want to get specific though in terms of what potential difference there is between those two terms, it's that an experience is what somebody perceives an event is what actually happens. It's interpretation versus an actual event. When we are talking about cognitive theory, that's really all about perception and interpretation. What actually happens is secondary to what people perceive is happening when we think about the causality or contribution to development of mental disorders. 
For avoidant personality disorder, the negative life experiences that were identified would be physical and sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, bullying, low expression of parental affection, and a lack of nurturing. Dependent personality disorder is associated with physical and sexual abuse, a controlling family environment, and a rule-based family environment. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is only weakly associated with negative life events.

1801,Borderline Personality Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder,2018-09-26,71303,2657,115,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between autism spectrum disorder and borderline personality disorder. When we talk about autism spectrum disorder we're talking about a disorder listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) that has deficits in social communication and social interaction as well as restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior interests and activities. Borderline personality disorder is also in the DSM, however, this is a personality disorder, specifically a cluster B personality disorder, so it's in the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. With borderline personality disorder we see a pattern of unstable relationships, unstable mood, impulsivity, identity disturbance, and anger, so at first glance it appears there are a lot of differences between these two disorders. We believe that they don't usually get confused with one another, for example, you won't see one of these disorders listed as a potential differential diagnosis for the other. This alone doesn't mean there's no risk of confusing the two, but it is an indicator. Usually we would expect that a diagnosis would be listed as a differential diagnosis, if there were a significant risk of confusing the two disorders. What we see with these two disorders rather is an overlap, particularly at the cognitive level. Adding to the potential confusion, of course, is that these two disorders can be comorbid. An individual can be diagnosed with both borderline personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder at the same time. We know there are a lot of differences between these two disorders. If we compare them using the five-factor model (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism), we see that when we compare borderline personality disorder to autism spectrum disorder, we would expect to see higher levels of openness to experience, higher levels of extraversion, lower levels of conscientiousness, and higher levels of neuroticism with borderline personality disorder. Both disorders tend to have the same level of agreeableness and similar levels of social avoidance, callousness, and restricted expressiveness.

1802,Do Personality Disorders Predict Negative Life Events (and Positive Life Events)?,2018-09-24,3398,149,12,"This video answers the question: Do personality disorders predict negative life events? When we talk about personality disorders, we know that there are a number of potential negative outcomes. They are conceptualized as extremes of personality traits and this can lead to difficulties. Using the five-factor model of personality theory and then examining negative life events and positive life events, is a fairly common way to understand the impact of personality disorders. Before we get into personality disorders, it's important to understand that personality traits do have fairly good predictive power in terms of predicting negative life events. Studies have shown that their predictive power is as strong as socioeconomic status or cognitive ability, for example. We know that personality disorders are conceptualized as extreme levels of personality traits so it makes sense that personality traits could predict negative or positive life events. We know that personality disorders have an association with negative life events and they also have an association with having fewer positive life events. On the negative life events side, we see events like unemployment, arrests, incarceration, and poor relationships being predicted by personality disorders. Negative life events aren't simply inconvenient or considered a mildly poor outcome, rather they can have very severe consequences. Negative life events are linked to substance use disorder and suicide attempts. We know that with certain personality disorders there are specific negative life events that seem to predict suicide attempts. For example, with narcissistic personality disorder, illness, injury, financial problems, and arguments with the spouse seem to predict suicide attempts. With antisocial personality disorder, the death of a spouse does and with borderline personality disorder, troubles and relationships seem to predict suicide attempts. What do we know about non-clinical populations and the five-factor model? We know that extraversion seems to be linked to positive life events in general, including gaining new friends and finding employment. Conscientiousness is also linked to positive life events and neuroticism is linked to negative life events. Openness to experience is a bit interesting in terms of its relationship to different life events, because it's really related to both positive life events and negative life events.

1803,Is Borderline Personality Disorder Actually a Trait Disorder?,2018-09-21,17069,682,50,"This video answers the question: Is borderline personality disorder really a trait disorder? First, I'm going to take a look at borderline personality disorder, then compare trait versus state, and then look at the results from a study on the topic. Borderline personality disorder is a cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This is in the dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster. There are nine symptom criteria: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationship pattern, identity disturbance, impulsivity at least two areas that could be self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. Borderline personality disorder is conceptualized as a trait disorder as the name would indicate. It's considered to be stable over time. A lot of times when we think about borderline personality, we think of a set of symptoms that don't tend to change much over time. It's also conceptualized by many clinicians as difficult to treat - a chronic disorder, but we know from prior research that the remission rate for borderline personality disorder over a ten-year period may be as high as 85%. This means that individuals who did meet the full criteria for the disorder, no longer meet it after ten years, about 85% of time. Interestingly, this doesn't mean that the overall functioning improves much. We see kind of mixed results here - a fairly high remission rate, at least as we would normally conceptualize borderline personality disorder, but functioning that tends to still remain fairly low. We also know that with borderline personality disorder that the severity level of the symptoms tends to change quite a bit. This doesn't necessarily mean it's directional, like the remission information, but rather there's a lot of trait instability. This brings me to the comparison between trait and state. What this means is there's a stable part of mental disorders, which is the trait part, and there's a part that tends to be more situational, which is the state part. Borderline personality disorder is usually conceptualized as a trait disorder, but research indicates that the disorder is only 45% trait based and 55% state based.

1804,What is Schema Therapy?,2018-09-19,39387,1134,26,"The video answers the question: What is schema therapy? When we talk about schema therapy, we're talking about a treatment modality that was developed in the 1980s by a clinician named Jeffrey Young. It was specifically developed to address personality disorders or in some cases chronic and complex characterological problems. Schema therapy is the type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a family of modalities and we could think of schema therapy specifically as being a modified version of Beck’s cognitive therapy. We see four parts to schema therapy: early maladaptive schemas, schema domains, schema modes, and coping styles. With early maladaptive schemas we have a dysfunctional theme that develops starting in childhood and it has emotional cognitive and memory components to it as well as bodily sensations. These are about the self or about others, so really this type of schema is not a lot different than what we think of when we think of a cognitive therapy schema. These early maladaptive schemas developed for a variety of reasons and again the start of the development is in childhood. It's thought that if a child is exposed to hostility, neglect, criticism, or there is a failure to meet core needs, that these early maladaptive schemas can take hold. Coping styles are initially used by individuals for developing these schemas to survive, but eventually they start to maintain that maladaptive schema. There are three main types of coping styles in schema therapy: overcompensation, surrendering, and avoidance. The last component is the schema mode and the schema modes are groups of schemas. These are used with schema therapy for complex disorders and one of those disorders is borderline personality. Schema therapy has a few different goals associated with it, but the main goals would be to develop close relationships with others and to promote self-care.

When we talk about the term psychopathy, we're talking about a construct. It's not a mental disorder like antisocial personality order, but it is related to antisocial personality disorder. The term subclinical doesn't rise to a clinical level. Subclinical presentations of psychopathy would not warrant treatment, so a lot of times we talk about subclinical presentations, we're talking about research that's in the area of businesses and organizations, and not to advance mental health treatment. It's important remember with psychopathy that there are two major types: primary and secondary. With primary psychopathy, we see antisocial behavior, being selfish, manipulative, callous, calculating, having superficial charm, being deceitful, and being dominant in social situations. We also see a decreased ability to experience certain emotions like guilt, remorse, fear, and anxiety. One of the areas that we see here with these emotions is when somebody has a decreased experience of these emotions, they have stress immunity, and this can be helpful in business settings. When we look at secondary psychopathy, we see traits like being impulsive, antagonistic, non-conforming, and having high levels of anxiety, anger, and depression as well as being volatile and having high stress reactivity.",Sep,Dr. Todd Grande
1806,What is Death Anxiety?,2018-09-15,67309,1874,84,"This video answers the question: What is death anxiety? When we talk about the construct of death anxiety, we're talking about an unpleasant emotion that's brought about by existential concerns, so when somebody's contemplating their own death or the death of other people. Death anxiety is normal and it's not inherently maladaptive. Some level of death anxiety works to actually reduce the risk of being involved in dangerous situations. Death anxiety can also lead to other positive coping mechanisms, however, an extreme level of death anxiety can lead to problems. We see maladaptive coping strategies and feelings of terror sometimes with death anxiety. Death anxiety is considered to be a stable, distinct trait, not a state. It is not an emotion that comes and goes quickly, but rather a part of the personality. A lot of times death anxiety is conceptualized as just another expression of generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, but actually death anxiety is considered distinct. We see that the overlap, for example, with generalized anxiety disorder is only about 15 to 20%. Death anxiety is more stable over time than generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder and those two disorders respond better to treatment than does death anxiety. Even though death anxiety is relatively stable as individuals age, it tends to decrease over time. One of the theories about this is that realizing that death is nearby, that it is inevitable and closer normally of course as people age, creates this desire to focus on the present and build relationships. We believe that is the mechanism that operates as people age, but we also know that other stable personality constructs tend to change with age as well. For example, agreeableness increases as individuals age as does conscientiousness. Neuroticism decreases with age and, of course, it would make sense that there's a link between death anxiety and neuroticism. Death anxiety is considered to be transdiagnostic and what that term means is it's a construct we see across a number of mental disorders. In and of itself it's not a mental disorder. We see it manifests oftentimes in panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and also a number of the specific phobias that are related to elements that could lead to death or that would be dangerous (e.g. being afraid of heights or spiders). Effective treatment of these various mental disorders may also lead to a decrease in death anxiety, but as I mentioned we consider death anxiety to be a trait. It's stable and this really explains why it seems to be resistant to treatment, but that doesn't mean it cannot be addressed in therapy. A number of other personality traits are addressed in therapy and sometimes quite effectively (e.g. some personality disorders).",Sep,Dr. Todd Grande
1807,The Relationship Between Psychopathy and Intelligence,2018-09-12,61006,2367,84,"This video answers the question: What is the association between psychopathy and intelligence? When we think of the word “psychopathy,” there is this idea that psychopathic traits are related to intelligence, meaning the more we see of psychopathy the higher level of intelligence we see. This goes back in the media in terms of movies, television, and even early research into psychopathy and intelligence. One of the difficulties here is that we don't really have a single agreed-upon definition of psychopathy and we don't have a single agreed-upon definition of intelligence. Psychopathy can be understood in a number of different ways and there are several different instruments that measure psychopathy. A lot of our understanding really comes from how those instruments break down the construct of psychopathy. One of those popular instruments is the Psychopathy Checklist Revised and another popular instrument is the Psychopathic Personality Inventory Revised. If we look at the PCL, we see that there are different number of factors depending on which version of the instrument. One popular conceptualization is a two-factor model and each of those factors may have one or two lower order factors. If we look at Factor 1 we see interpersonal and affective traits like superficial charm, callousness, and being egocentric. Factor 2 is where we see antisocial behavior and sometimes lifestyle. Here we'd see irresponsibility, impulsivity, and violating society's norms, so largely thought of as criminality. A lot of times of course we think of psychopathy, we also think of antisocial personality disorder. That's an official diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's a cluster B personality disorder. The Factor 2 that we see what psychopathy would be more closely related to antisocial personality disorder than the Factor 1. Sometimes Factor 1 is even conceptualized as being helpful in some ways. A lot of times we think of psychopathy overall as destructive and related to criminality, but it really depends on which traits someone has. Another instrument was the Psychopathic Personality Inventory Revised and here we also see two factors, although there is a third factor which isn't used as much. The first two factors would be fearless dominance and self-centered impulsivity. Roughly speaking, fearless dominance lines up with Factor 1 except you also see characteristics like stress immunity, social boldness, and physical fearlessness. Self-centered impulsiveness is similar to Factor 2. The third factor I mentioned that we don't really use too often the cold-heartedness factor and usually that's thought of as separate. Here we see lack of empathy lack of remorse, lovelessness, and guiltlessness. 
Research has found that there is no relationship between psychopathy and intelligence. In terms of whether intelligence is a protective factor against criminality, intelligence may actually be a protective factor with fearless dominance but with self-centered impulsivity higher intelligence actually puts the individual at more risk for antisocial behavior.

1808,Treatment Strategies for Borderline Personality Disorder,2018-09-10,68698,1845,64,"This video answers the questions: What are some treatment strategies we see for borderline personality disorder? When we talk about borderline personality disorder we're talking about a cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. We know that treatment of borderline personality disorder can be particularly challenging due to some of the properties and characteristics associated with the disorder. Some of the symptoms of borderline personality disorder typically include impulsivity, suicidal gestures, identity disturbance, interpersonal difficulties, frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, and other factors that could interfere with the delivery of effective treatment. We know with borderline personality disorder that individual talk therapy treatment psychotherapy can be effective in a number of instances but no single modality has really stood out as being more effective than other modalities. It's important when we review strategies that we know where those strategies are going to work in terms of modality placement. When we think of factors that are common across many modalities, of course, one of the first things we think of is the therapeutic relationship. A lot of times when we talk about the therapeutic relationship, we are specifically talking about the therapeutic alliance, which is how the client and the therapist rate the quality of that therapeutic relationship. A strong therapeutic alliance is a good predictor of treatment outcomes and of retention in therapy. The treatment alliance accounts for more variance in the outcome of treating borderline personality disorder than any other single variable. Many strategies are designed to enhance the therapeutic alliance. The first strategy is cultivating emotional awareness. This is an increase in awareness and acceptance of the client and the client’s feelings. The second strategy is structuring treatment. This is really structuring the treatment overall, not the type of structuring that would be specific to certain types of cognitive behavioral therapy, for example, where each session is structured. The third strategy is therapist responsiveness. This really has to do with the communication style and the attitude of the clinician. The fourth strategy is supervision and team involvement. The last strategy is exploring ruptures.

1809,Examples of Histrionic Personality Disorder Symptom Manifestations,2018-09-08,295358,8756,351,"This video provides examples of symptom manifestations for Histrionic Personality Disorder. Personality Disorders are thought to be chronic and long lasting, however, treatments are available. Histrionic Personality Disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms including wanting to be the center of attention, sexually seductive behavior, rapidly shifting and shallow emotions, an effort to gain attention through physical appearance, impressionistic speech pattern, self-dramatizing, exaggerated emotional expressions, theatrical, easily influenced, and believe relationships are more intimate than they really are. Individuals with Histrionic Personality Disorder tend to struggle with relationships and sometimes seek treatment from depressive symptoms from losing relationships. The prevalence of Histrionic Personality Disorder is about 3%. Histrionic Personality Disorder is highly comorbid with Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and depressive disorders, somatic symptom disorder, and conversion disorder.",Sep,Dr. Todd Grande
1810,Experiential Avoidance and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder,2018-09-05,22176,696,14,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between experiential avoidance and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)? When we talk about obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, we're talking about a Cluster C personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. OCPD is different than obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD. We see a number of symptoms in the symptom criteria for OCPD including, a preoccupation with details, perfectionism, excessive devotion to work and productivity, overconscientiousness, an inability to throw out worn out or worthless items, reluctance to delegate tasks, a miserly spending style, and being rigid and stubborn. We also know that OCPD is a fairly common personality disorder. About 8% of population would qualify for a diagnosis of OCPD and it's thought to be the most prevalent personality in the general population. In clinical populations, it's thought to be the third most prevalent, so it's behind avoidant and borderline personality disorders. In terms of the prevalence, of course, it depends on which research studies you look at. There's not perfect agreement about prevalence, but either way we know that OCPD is fairly common and there's not a lot of research about this disorder. We know that with OCPD there is impaired functioning, but there's also some potential benefits with this disorder and this makes it a little bit unusual as compared to the other personality disorders. Even though we think the negative aspects of OCPD are worse than the positive aspects are good, we know there are some positive aspects particularly around work productivity. This shouldn't be surprising considering that's one of the symptom criteria with OCPD. 
Experiential avoidance is an unwillingness to experience unpleasant thoughts, sensations, and emotions. These attempts to avoid unpleasant feelings that we see with experiential avoidance oftentimes result in an increase in symptom severity, duration, and frequency. This is exactly the opposite expectation that somebody would have when they try to avoid unpleasant feelings. With OCPD, the mechanism of avoidance is thought to be maladaptive attempts to control. There is a positive correlation between experiential avoidance and OCPD. We also see that higher experiential avoidance in individuals who have OCPD was associated with a lower quality of life.

1811,"Relational Aggression, the FFM, and Personality Disorders",2018-09-03,6747,282,10,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between relational aggression and personality disorders? When we talk about relational aggression, we're talking about behaviors that are intended to damage interpersonal relationships and social status. Individuals who are relationally aggressive cause damage to other people, but relational aggression also has negative consequences for the aggressor. Individuals who perpetrate relational aggression have a higher risk of mental disorders including personality disorders, difficulty in school, and peer rejection. We also see with relational aggression that it is a consistent pattern of behavior. It's an interactional style that doesn't appear to be isolated and discrete, but rather consistent and stable. It also tends to develop early in life, in late childhood, or early adolescence and it's associated with interpersonal instability and jealousy. With this understanding of relational aggression, it's easy to see a connection specifically to personality disorders and even more specifically to Cluster B personality disorders: antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, and histrionic. Cluster B is considered the emotional, dramatic, and erratic cluster. Prior studies have shown an association with all of those personality disorders in cluster B, but particularly with antisocial personality disorder. Overall, there's not a lot of research on relational aggression and personality disorders. One way to study these constructs is with the five-factor model of personality. The five-factor model has five personality traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. We can remember the five factor model traits through the acronym OCEAN.

1812,Narcissism and Romantic Partner Selection,2018-09-01,16916,558,33,"This video answers the question: Do individuals with narcissism tend to look for certain characteristics in romantic partners? When we talk about this construct of narcissism sometimes we think of the disorder: “narcissistic personality disorder.” Narcissism runs on a continuum and has several different characteristics associated with it. Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental disorder and is conceptualized as having extreme personality traits related to narcissism. Narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder are really two different constructs although, of course, there's a lot of overlap there. We know that narcissism, whether it's subclinical narcissism or narcissistic personality disorder, tends to interfere with romantic relationships and it's fairly easy to see why there would be some level of interference. If we look at the symptom criteria for narcissistic personality disorder, for example, we see characteristics like exploiting people interpersonally, a sense of entitlement, envy, grandiosity, lack of empathy, and arrogance. All of which, of course, could interfere with relationships. If we look at associated characteristics of narcissism in general, we see characteristics like being vindictive or having a lot of antagonism. Again, it is fairly clear to see how this would make romantic relationships challenging. Also, narcissism is associated with a low commitment level in relationships, although a lot of the research on this has been looking at individuals who are dating as opposed to married. We see that this low commitment may be explained by this overvaluing of certain elements of relationship like physical enjoyment and undervaluing other aspects like emotional connectedness. There are essentially two theories are romantic partner selection and narcissism: there's the similar theory and the dissimilar theory. With the similar theory, individuals with narcissistic traits tend to look for other individuals who are confident, ambitious, and they're not particularly concerned with how considerate somebody would be. If we line this with a five-factor model of personality theory an individual has narcissistic traits would look for high extraversion and low agreeableness. With the dissimilar model, the theory is that individuals who have narcissistic traits would be looking for someone who's easy to manipulate. Putting that in terms of the five-factor model: high neuroticism and low extraversion. What's interesting here as we look at this similar versus dissimilar theory, is that there is no clear evidence to support either theory. Individuals who have narcissistic traits don't seem to look for any particular type of romantic partner as far as personality theory.

1813,Are Avoidant Personality Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder Different?,2018-08-30,17326,633,26,"This video answers the question: Are avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety disorder actually different disorders? There's a debate in the mental health treatment community about these two disorders and sometimes it's really not a matter of how are they different it really, it is a matter of people that believe that one of these must not exist. I think the one that gets targeted more often, of course, is avoidant personality. In previous videos have also discussed how we have to use the research sometimes on social anxiety disorder to draw inferences about avoidant personality, because there is not a lot of research on avoidant personality disorder. This just speaks to the same challenge: are these two disorders really separate? I'm going to revisit this question but from a slightly different angle. I'm not going to go through the item-level analysis of the symptoms like I've done before, but rather give an overview of these two disorders and an overview of where we are in terms of our understanding. With social anxiety disorder there are many symptom criteria like anxiety and avoidance in social situations. With social anxiety disorder this may be specific, there's even a specifier “performance only” that's for performing or speaking in public. The idea here is that social anxiety disorder is not conceptualized as the manifestation of extreme personality traits, rather the symptoms of this disorder can come and go. They're not really necessarily stable over time as I indicated. We could think of a short version to remember what social anxiety disorder is all about is really something like “performance in social situations.” Avoidant personality disorder is conceptualized as more stable, it's a maladaptive pattern like we see with all personality disorders. The pattern here is one of social inhibition, so we see a lot of different emotions and feelings associated with social situations like a fear of being rejected, criticized, embarrassed, feelings of inadequacy, and being inept or inferior. This is quite similar to social anxiety disorder, but from a different angle. If we're trying to sum up what avoidant personality disorder is, we would say there's difficulties here in forming relationships. We could easily remember the main difference between these disorders as forming versus performing, difficulty in forming relationships with avoidant personality disorder and difficulty performing in social situations with social anxiety disorder.

1814,The Nature of Stigma with Social Anxiety Disorder,2018-08-28,9826,433,31,"This video answers the question: What is the nature of stigma as it relates to social anxiety disorder? Social anxiety disorder is a mental disorder listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). We see several different symptoms with this disorder: fear or anxiety in social situations, a fear of negative evaluation, and social situations are avoided or they are endured with intense fear and anxiety. Social anxiety disorder carries a lot of negative consequences for an individual who has it. We know that social anxiety disorder does carry a stigma and there have been several articles that have talked about this in one way or another. The definition of stigma is not always clear as there are actually many definitions available. Stigma is a hard construct to study accurately. One definition would be that stigma is distinguishing individuals as different and labeling them in an effort to create social distance. We relate stigma to social distance because this idea of social distance or a desire to create social distance is a lot easier to measure than the construct of stigma. Oftentimes, when we talk about stigma we're really talking about this degree of wanting social distance. We know that with social anxiety disorder about 80% of individuals who have this disorder won't receive treatment. Now if we look at major depressive disorder as a comparison, about 40% of individuals with major depressive disorder won't receive treatment. When we look at mental illness and stigma in general, there are certain constructs associated with the desire to create more social distance, specifically dangerousness, personal responsibility, and rarity. 
What about the factors that contribute to stigma specifically? Social anxiety disorder is actually one of the least stigmatized mental disorders. That doesn't mean the consequences of the stigma associated with it aren't severe, but compared to a number of other mental disorders social anxiety disorder just doesn't have the same level of stigma associated with it. When individuals perceive certain symptoms that increases the social distance they want to create. With social anxiety disorder, those symptoms were when individuals viewed the symptoms as more avoidable, more common in women, and more likely to lead to work difficulties. Those factors predicted greater social distance with social anxiety disorder. Interestingly, those factors did not predict greater social distance with major depressive disorder. Overall, there was a greater preference for social distance associated major depressive disorder than for social anxiety disorder and also personal responsibility was not a predictor of social distance with social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or mental illness in general.",Aug,Dr. Todd Grande
1815,Does Comorbid Borderline and Substance Use Disorder Worsen BPD Symptoms?,2018-08-27,10707,342,34,"This video answers the question: Does comorbid borderline personality disorder and substance use disorder make the symptoms of borderline personality worse? When we talk about borderline personality disorder we're talking about a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). We see a number of symptoms associated with borderline personality including self-destructive tendencies, impulsivity, anger, irritability, mood lability, difficulty in relationships, identity disturbance, and a number of other symptoms. We know that borderline personality disorder has a high level of comorbidity, that is co-occurrence, with substance use disorders. Depending on the research that you look at, it is anywhere between 40 to 60% of individuals with borderline personality will have a comorbid substance use disorder. Both of these disorders can have similar components to them, for example, impulsivity, self-destructive tendencies, and affective instability. Both are associated with adverse childhood experiences, so we believe that the etiological factors and risk factors are similar for borderline personality disorder and substance use disorder. Some of the adverse childhood experiences related to both of these disorders would be abuse, neglect, and dysfunctional family dynamics. Now there's been some research on the comorbidity between these two disorders and we see that there are some different factors that are associated with this comorbidity. For example, with comorbid borderline personality and substance use disorder we see an increased risk of more severe substance use symptoms. Also, the treatment outcomes are poor, we see increased risk for suicide, increased self-destructive tendencies, an increased risk of failing to attain remission from borderline personality disorder, and increased impulsivity. But all the research here doesn't point in the same direction.

1816,Psychopathy and Moral Judgment,2018-08-25,29256,1179,61,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between psychopathy and moral judgment? When we talk about the concept of psychopathy, a lot of times we think of the diagnosis antisocial personality disorder listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, but really psychopathy is similar, but it's still a distinct construct. We see a lot of the same symptoms with psychopathy that we see with the antisocial personality disorder and some symptoms we would expect only to see with psychopathy. It's also important to remember that psychopathy is not a mental health disorder. With psychopathy we see symptoms like violating society's norms, criminality, being manipulative, callousness, being impulsive, being irresponsible, and having lack of empathy. Usually when we conceptualize psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder, we usually think of it this way: just about everybody who has psychopathy would qualify for diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, but not everybody who qualifies for diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder would have psychopathy. If we look at those characteristics I mentioned, it's easy to see why there's this theory that there's a deficit and moral competence with psychopathy. When I use the term moral competence, I'm specifically talking about the ability to distinguish right from wrong. When we look at the research on psychopathy and moral judgment, we know that the major theory is that moral competence theory, which says there must be a deficit in the ability to distinguish right and wrong, but there's also a theory about the moral conventional distinction, that is this difference between harming somebody and violating a social norm. One of the theories with psychopathy is that individuals with these traits have difficulty making that distinction. They can't tell the difference between harming someone and violating a social convention. There's been a lot of research on psychopathy and moral judgment, but a lot of the studies don't analyze moral judgment directly. It's an abstract concept, so they look at concepts that are related to moral judgment and infer that individuals with psychopathy have deficits in that area. When we look at some of the studies that attempt to directly measure moral judgment, we see that they fail to identify any type of deficit in the area of moral dilemmas, moral justification, or that moral conventional distinction I spoke about a moment ago.

1817,What is the Difference Between Pathological Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder?,2018-08-22,28174,1008,34,"This video answers the question: What is the difference between pathological narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder. When we talk about narcissistic personality disorder and compare it to pathological narcissism, it's important to understand that narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a diagnosis listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's a diagnosis a client could receive if they demonstrated certain symptoms and, of course, this diagnosis can only be given by a licensed and qualified clinician. Pathological narcissism is a construct and we use pathological narcissism in research, but it's not a diagnosis, rather it's on a continuum. NPD as it's described in the DSM, has nine symptom criteria: grandiose sense of self-importance, fantasies of unlimited power or success (a lot of times I just think of this really as exaggerated fantasies as they're not always unlimited), this idea of being special or unique and that only certain special or unique people would understand somebody, a need for excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, exploiting other individuals interpersonally, having a lack of empathy, having envy for other people and believing other people envy you, and being arrogant, haughty, pretentious, or supercilious. The symptom criteria for NPD differ from the definition of pathological narcissism. With pathological narcissism, we see a number of qualities that aren't captured in the symptom criteria for NPD and also with pathological narcissism two types of narcissism are appreciated at the same time: grandiose and vulnerable. With grandiose narcissism, we see a lot of overlap with the symptom criteria of NPD. There are characteristics like being arrogant or exploiting others interpersonally. We don't see hardly any over at all with vulnerable narcissism. We see characteristics like mood lability, being shy, being self-critical, having fragile self-esteem, having feelings of inadequacy, perfectionism, and hypersensitivity. As we compare NPD with pathological narcissism, we see that NPD does focus on grandiose narcissism and pathological narcissism covers both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. If we look at the associated features for NPD in the DSM, we do see a discussion of this idea of being self-critical and of having social withdrawal, so some of the elements of vulnerable narcissism are captured there in the associated features. If you consider the dimensional model in the DSM, this is listed as the alternative model for personality disorders, we do see that some of the other characteristics associated with vulnerable narcissism are captured, but it's still not complete.

1818,How Do Social Interactions Affect Individuals with Avoidant & Borderline Personality Disorders?,2018-08-20,49581,1796,82,"This video answers the question: How do social interactions affect individuals with avoidant personality disorder and those with borderline personality disorder? When we look at the research that has information about social interactions, or a construct called social proximity, it's important to remember that a lot of times when we look at avoidant personality disorder, we're looking at information that was gathered from individuals have social anxiety disorder. This is because these two disorders are similar and it's difficult to find participants who have avoidant personality disorder. We know from research on social anxiety disorder that being alone - not being in social proximity - can be problematic. It can result in less positive mood and more negative mood, so really when we look at this question about social interactions and avoidant personality disorder, what's being asked here is: does avoidant personality disorder respond the same way as social anxiety disorder? We know that avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a number of feelings that seem to be related to social situations and relationships including: embarrassment, feeling inept or inferior, and being worried about being criticized or rejected. It wouldn't be surprising that with these types of characteristics and symptoms that social proximity would have some sort of negative effect on individuals with avoidant personality disorder, but we also know that individuals with avoidant personality tend to desire social relationships, so we would expect some positive effects as well. It's important to understand when we talk about social interactions or social proximity that there are a few different ways to measure these constructs. Social proximity can be measured as the frequency of social proximity (person-level), and also the effective quality of being in or out of social proximity, so comparing how someone's mood is when they're around other people (moment-level). We see from research that social proximity has a positive effect for individuals who do not have personality disorder, but it has mixed results for individuals with avoidant or borderline personality disorder. It’s particularly interesting that one of the defining characteristics for each of these disorders (anxiety for avoidant personality disorder and anger for borderline personality disorder) increased when an individual was in social proximity.

A lot of times when you hear the word “psychopathy,” we think of antisocial personality disorder, which is a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). There is a lot of overlap between these two constructs, but they're not exactly the same thing. Usually the way we think of psychopathy is that everybody who has psychopathy would qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, or at least the vast majority would, but not everybody who has antisocial personality disorder would qualify as having psychopathy. We see a number of characteristics associated with psychopathy and many of these we also see with antisocial personality disorder. A few of the characteristics with psychopathy would be a lack of empathy, narcissism (in particular grandiosity), impulsivity, irresponsibility, callousness, a superficial charm, an ability and a desire to manipulate other people, and violating social norms.

1820,Borderline Personality Disorder and Facial Expression Recognition,2018-08-15,7907,327,27,"This video answers question: Does borderline personality disorder affect one's ability to recognize facial expressions? When we talk about borderline personality, we know there are a number of key characteristics associated with it and one of those is a difficulty with interpersonal relationships. A lot of times we think of this as a defining feature of borderline personality disorder. We also know that correctly recognizing facial expressions and being able to accurately identify the emotions associated with them, are important to interpersonal relationships, so it makes sense to have this hypothesis that with borderline personality disorder, there may be some type of impairment in recognizing facial expressions correctly. This might lead to some of the problems with interpersonal relationships. This idea is generally supported in the research. We've identified deficits in recognizing neutral and ambiguous facial expressions in individuals with borderline personality disorder. We also see that many articles have this element of bias indicated as well and particularly a negative bias, so it's not just an inability to recognize the facial expressions, it's adding something negative into those facial expressions that wasn't actually there. There is evidence that suggests that this deficit and recognizing facial expressions associated borderline personality disorder is for all of the facial expressions, although some articles indicate that this impairment seems to be especially evident for anger and disgust. Research indicates that individuals with borderline personality have lower intensity ratings for happiness when looking at happy facial expressions, but there was no difference when evaluating angry facial expressions. Individuals with borderline personality disorder had lower confidence in all of their assessments of facial expressions, but especially those for the happy facial expressions. This lower confidence is linked to increased feelings of loneliness and an increased expectation of social rejection. Some individuals with borderline personality disorder, when they're in an argument with another individual, may have a compromised ability to detect signals that the other individual is trying to end the argument (like signals of cooperation, for example). When an argument would naturally have less intensity, an individual who has borderline personality disorder, may not be able to see those signals and therefore wouldn't respond in a way to help that argument to end.

1821,What is the Difference Between Primary and Secondary Psychopathy?,2018-08-13,73212,2868,113,"This video answers the question: What is the difference between primary and secondary psychopathy? When we talk about the construct of psychopathy, we are talking about a construct that is fairly similar to the mental disorder “antisocial personality disorder,” which is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Actually, psychopathy is similar to all of the Cluster B personality disorders: antisocial, narcissistic, and to a lesser extent it is associated with borderline and histrionic personality disorder. The way we could think of these two constructs, psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder, would be that antisocial personality disorder is defined mostly based on behaviors and psychopathy is defined partially on behaviors, but it also adds this interpersonal component. The way these two constructs are measured is a bit different and the way they're used in the research is a bit different. Usually the way we think about them is that most everyone who has psychopathy would also qualify for antisocial personality disorder, but only some individuals with antisocial personality would also qualify as having psychopathy. When we look at the construct of psychopathy a little more closely we see that it can be divided in the two major types and that's what I'm really talking about here in today's video: primary versus secondary psychopathy. A lot of times the term primary psychopathy can be synonymous with the term psychopathy. A lot of times when individuals in research say psychopathy, they really mean primary psychopathy. Secondary psychopathy is sometimes referred to as sociopathy. This term is not common in the research literature anymore, but it really does have the strongest relationship with this construct of secondary psychopathy. This can become a bit confusing because when you hear the term psychopathy, it's not really clear if it's referring to the entire construct or just primary psychopathy. Additionally, sometimes when individuals use sociopathy, they're really talking about psychopathy as opposed to just secondary psychopathy. When we look at primary psychopathy we know there are certain characteristics associated with it: being unemotional, callous, manipulative, calculating, having little or no fear, guilt, remorse, empathy, or anxiety. We also tend to think of primary psychopathy as having an etiology that is genetic more so than environmental. Psychopathy has a fairly strong association with antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. When we talk about secondary psychopathy, we see a different set of characteristics. Sometimes secondary psychopathy is referred to by this term antisocial deviance. Secondary psychopathy is more associated with criminal behavior than is primary psychopathy. We also see a number of other characteristics: being rash, impulsive, emotional, anxious, hostile, aggressive, volatile, and self-destructive. Individuals that secondary psychopathy also tend to be more disorganized and tend to have a risky decision-making style when compared to individuals with primary psychopathy.",Aug,Dr. Todd Grande
1822,Do Personality Disorder Symptoms Predict Divorce?,2018-08-11,9395,253,19,"This video answers the question: Do personality disorder symptoms predict divorce? We know that the construct of multiple divorces (when individuals get divorced a number of times throughout their life) is associated with anxiety,  paranoid ideation, and global distress. We also know that borderline and antisocial personality disorders have been associated with separation, marital distress, low marital satisfaction, and divorce. Marital disruption, which of course is different than divorce, has been associated with paranoid, schizoid, antisocial, and histrionic personality disorders, as well as all three of the Cluster C personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder). There seems to be no question that personality disorders can tax a marriage, but here we're looking specifically at divorce. The findings here were fairly interesting: increased levels of paranoid and histrionic personality disorders were associated with higher divorce rates, but none of the personalities disorders other than those were associated with higher divorce rates. Avoidant personality disorder symptoms were negatively associated with the number of divorces. The higher the level of symptoms the fewer divorces were observed. The next question is: Why do we have these findings? With paranoid personality disorder, we see characteristics like suspiciousness, hostility, and jealousy, so it's not surprising looking at those characteristics that they would interfere in a marital relationship. With histrionic personality disorder, we see attention-seeking behavior, inappropriate sexually seductive behavior, and rapidly shifting and shallow emotions. Again, just looking at the symptoms associated with histrionic personality disorder, it's not surprising that that disorder would interfere with a marital relationship. Also, with histrionic personality disorder, we oftentimes see this desire to have a number of close relationships. Individuals with this disorder are oftentimes searching for intimacy with a number of people and again it's easy to connect this to the idea of marital disruption and of course eventually possibly divorce. Avoidant personality disorder has a negative association with divorce, which potentially could be explained by symptoms like not being assertive, social inhibition, and avoiding the criticizing of others. All these factors could lead to somebody avoiding divorce.

1823,Seven Myths about Schizoid Personality Disorder,2018-08-09,84080,2561,144,"In this video I'll be going over seven myths about schizoid personality disorder. Schizoid personality disorder Cluster A personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), which is in the same cluster as schizotypal and paranoid personality disorder. With schizoid personality disorder we see a pattern of detachment and a restricted range of the expression of emotions. Oftentimes individuals with schizoid personality disorder are referred to as being a “loner.” 
Myth number one is that schizoid personality disorder is the same thing as schizophrenia. It's understandable how this myth came into being as the terms seem similar, but schizophrenia is a distinct illness that has persistent psychotic symptoms and we don't see that with schizoid personality disorder. 
Myth number two is that there's an increased risk of violence with schizoid personality disorder. We hear this myth about a number of the personality disorders and a number of mental disorders in general. There's no evidence to suggest that there's a greater risk of violence with schizoid personality disorder than an individual who doesn't have schizoid personality disorder.
Myth number three is that individuals with schizoid personality disorder lack emotion. There certainly is, in many cases, a constriction of emotion, but difficulty is really in expressing emotions, not necessarily in having emotions. There are fewer stronger emotions reported with individuals have schizoid personality disorder, but that's not the same thing as lacking emotion.
Myth number four is that individuals with schizoid personality disorder have impaired vocational functioning. There is some impairment, particularly with jobs related to interpersonal relationships, but in terms of jobs that are solitary, individuals that schizoid personality disorder tend to do fairly well. 
Myth number five is that individuals with schizoid personality disorder have frequent psychosis. With schizoid personality disorder we sometimes see brief psychosis (according to the DSM). The psychosis would be minutes and sometimes hours, but it's not persistent like we would expect to see with schizophrenia.
Myth number six is that schizoid personality disorder doesn't co-occur with other personality disorders. I think that when we look at the other personality disorders, we see a relational component to them. Antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, dependent, and paranoid personality disorders all have these relational aspects and schizoid personality really doesn't. There's a lack of interest in developing close relationships, so it seems like somebody couldn't have schizoid personality disorder and a number of those other personality disorders, but actually schizoid personality disorder does tend to be comorbid with paranoid, schizotypal, and avoidant personality disorder.
Myth number seven is that individuals with schizoid personality disorder are paranoid. This isn't a symptom we typically see with schizoid personality disorder. If an individual with this disorder has paranoia the likely explanation is comorbidity.",Aug,Dr. Todd Grande
1824,What is the Relationship Between Codependent and Counterdependent Traits and Personality Disorders?,2018-08-07,24505,1002,49,"This video answers two related questions. What is the difference between codependency and counter dependency? How are these two constructs related to personality disorders? It's important to understand the distinction between codependency and counterdependency. The relationship with personality disorders is actually fascinating. First, I'll go over the concepts of codependency and counterdependency. Codependency is a set of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that actually has a few different meanings, but most of the time when we say codependent, we're talking about an individual who is in a relationship with another individual who has a substance use disorder, a mental disorder, or perhaps extreme personality traits. Most of the time we're talking about an individual in a relationship with somebody who has a substance use disorder. The behaviors we call codependence would be when an individual in that type of relationship supports that other individual who has a substance use disorder in a manner that's unhealthy. It's a boundary problem. A lot of times codependence is considered similar to the concept of enabling. An individual who is codependent enables the individual who uses substances to avoid the consequences of that behavior. There are a number of different features associated with codependent behavior including a need for control, a need for approval, boundary problems, concerns about abandonment, difficulty managing anger and frustration, not being very assertive, and not trusting other people. 
Counterdependence is a fear of intimacy, it's not an indifference toward intimacy. It's an aversion to being dependent even in a healthy way. Most individuals are dependent on other people and a lot of times this is normal and productive. With counterdependence, someone is so averse to being dependent in any way that it becomes unproductive. Counterdependence has number of associated features including fear of abandonment, being strong, independence, confident, tough, resilient, self-reliant, self-sufficient, autonomous, productive, low level of trust, being distant, cold, detached, avoidant, self-centered, perfectionistic, feeling that vulnerability is a weakness, being insensitive, and not forming close relationships with other people. Individuals who are counterdependent might believe that no one understands them or that they're too good for other people.",Aug,Dr. Todd Grande
1825,What is the Relationship Between Psychopathy and Emotional Intelligence?,2018-08-06,28211,1036,42,"This video answers the question: Is psychopathy linked with lower emotional intelligence? When we talk about psychopathy a lot of times we think of the mental health disorder antisocial personality disorder as it's listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), but psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder aren't exactly the same thing. We could think of antisocial personality disorder as being the official classification and psychopathy as being a particular version of antisocial personality disorder and this version has characteristics like grandiosity, impulsivity, irresponsibility, callousness, being manipulative, having a shallow affect, and violating society's norms. There is a lot of overlap there between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder. When we think of the term emotional intelligence, we're thinking of a construct that is not as well-defined a psychopathy, but there is a good deal of research on it. In general, we think of the definition as perceiving, managing, or reasoning about emotions both internally and externally. It's this ability to understand and manage emotions and apply them to oneself and apply them to others in the world. Emotional intelligence usually this is thought of as an adaptive ability, so it has a positive outcome. With higher emotional intelligence we see certain associations like better interpersonal relationships, fewer problems with interpersonal relationships, a lower instance of substance use disorders, a lower incidence of violence, and fewer health problems. Then we can make this link between psychopathy and emotional intelligence by taking some of the elements of psychopathy and relating them to what we see with emotional intelligence and realizing that a lot of those areas seem to represent a deficit emotional intelligence. For example, some of the characteristics of psychopathy like emotional detachment, lack of empathy, relational difficulties, trouble differentiating neutral words from emotional words, and a difficulty in recognizing facial expressions would appear to negatively associated with emotional intelligence. Research indicates that when we look at the relationship between psychopathy and experiential emotional intelligence, there is no association. With the relationship between psychopathy and strategic emotional intelligence, there is a modest association. This highlights the importance of conducting research and not just making assumptions that two constructs would be related.

1826,Cluster C Personality Disorders and Shame,2018-08-04,37560,1387,67,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between shame and the Cluster C personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder). Shame is a perception that individual has that they have some sort of defect in themselves. This perception is a distressing emotion and theoretically this emotion leads to withdrawing, fleeing, and attempting to escape. This is different than guilt because the behavior that comes from guilt is trying to make amends, so in comparing shame and guilt we usually think of shame as more problematic, particularly in the mental health treatment community. There are different ways to think about shame when we think about treating individuals who have mental health symptoms or mental disorders. One way of thinking about it is the idea of shame proneness and this is the propensity to experience shame across a number of different situations. This would be how likely somebody would be to experience shame in multiple situations. Shame proneness has been studied and has been associated with a number of different mental disorders and symptoms of mental disorders including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, hostility, aggression, eating disorders, and a fear of intimacy. Another construct around shame would be shame aversion and this is when somebody perceives shame as being particularly undesirable, unwanted, or painful.

1827,Avoidant Personality Disorder and the Recognition of Fear in Others,2018-08-04,61953,2130,92,"This video answers the question: Do individuals with avoidant personality disorder respond differently to fear in others? When we talk about avoidant personality disorder, we're talking about a construct that's fairly similar to social anxiety disorder. We know from the research that social anxiety disorder has this relationship with fear in other individuals, meaning individuals with social anxiety disorder tend to avoid fearful expressions in other people. So this question is really asking is that the same for avoidant personality disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) there are seven symptoms in the symptom criteria for avoidant personality disorder: avoiding occupational activities where there is significant interpersonal contact because of a fear of criticism disapproval or rejection, an unwillingness to form friendships unless there's a certainty of being liked, trouble with intimate relationships because of fear of shame, a preoccupation with criticism or rejection in social situations, being inhibited with new relationships, feeling inept or inferior, and a reluctance to take risks because of a fear of being embarrassed. There is a theory that avoidant personality disorder is linked to an impaired ability to recognize facial expressions. There are six facial expressions and these have been found to be facial expressions that are recognized across cultures: sadness, happiness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. Research indicates that individuals who have avoidant personality disorder may have difficulty identifying full expressions of fear, but do not appear to have impairment with recognizing the remaining facial expressions.

1828,Personality Traits Diagnostic Model of Personality Disorders in the DSM (Dimensional Model),2018-08-02,9962,312,34,"This video answers the question: What is the personality trait model of diagnosing personality disorders in the DSM? When we consider personality disorders in the DSM, we know that there are sections on categorically diagnosing these disorders. For example, a number of symptom criteria and so many of those symptoms must be fulfilled in order to qualify for a diagnosis. In the DSM, there's also an alternative model based on personality traits. We could argue this is an approach to be more dimensional rather than categorical in terms of diagnosing. This alternate model can be used instead of the categorical model under certain situations, for example, if the categorical model of personality disorders doesn't quite match up to the needs in the assessment. This is also just really a proposed set of criteria and a proposed methodology, so it's something is still being worked on, but right now is available to use. First, to understand this personality trait model, we have to understand the general criteria for personality disorder under this model. Here we see two main criteria and then a few other criteria. We would have to consider the two criteria that really stand out here would be A and B. Criterion A says that there needs to be moderate or more severe impairment in personality functioning and Criterion B indicates that you would need to have one or more pathological personality traits. Then we see other criteria and these are like some other sets of criteria we see in other places in the DSM, including that this impairment that's referred to in criterion a must be inflexible and pervasive, the personality traits need to be stable, and the onset needs to be traced back to adolescence or early adulthood. We also see that the disturbance can't be better explained by another mental disorder, substance use, or from a medical condition. The disturbance would not be considered normal for the developmental stage or for the socio-cultural environment. Using this alternative model based on personality traits only six personality disorder can be diagnosed so from Cluster A we see only schizotypal (no schizoid and no paranoid personality disorder), from Cluster B we see antisocial, narcissistic, and borderline (no histrionic), and from Cluster C we see avoidant personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (no dependent personality disorder).",Aug,Dr. Todd Grande
1829,What Causes the Anger Component of Borderline Personality Disorder?,2018-07-31,163302,5746,249,"This video answers the question: What causes the anger component of borderline personality disorder? Borderline personality disorder has nine symptom criteria and that five criteria have to be met for a diagnosis of the disorder. Sometimes when we look at causation of disorders like borderline personality we're interested in what causes the disorder in general, but sometimes it's more helpful to look at a specific symptom of the disorder, even though that symptom isn't always present in every manifestation of the disorder. When we talk about anger and borderline personality disorder, we're talking about one specific symptom criterion. First, I'll go through all the symptom criteria and then into more detail about the anger. Again, there are nine symptom criteria with borderline personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable and intense relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity, suicidal behavior, affective instability, a chronic feeling of emptiness, inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation. Specifically looking at the anger, it's important to understand that trait anger is different than state anger and both of those are different than what we see in borderline personality disorder. There's a lot of overlap particularly between trait anger and that symptom of borderline personality, but they're not the same thing. Trait anger can cause difficulty for individuals even when they don't meet the full criteria for borderline personality disorder and that symptom of borderline personality disorder. -- the inappropriate intense anger - that can be present even if somebody doesn't have borderline personality disorder. There are a lot of different consequences to anger, which I'll talk about in a moment but first it is important to understand the difference between trait and state anger. State anger is episodic and fairly normal. Most everybody will have state anger from time to time in their lives. Trait anger is an aspect of personality and that's why we tend to think of trait anger as much more related to this anger symptom criterion in borderline personality disorder. This anger symptom criterion is actually the most prevalent symptom criterion with borderline personality. It's more prevalent than the other eight symptom criteria and it's the most prevalent in clinical and non-clinical samples. It's also the most prevalent and first-degree relatives of individuals with borderline personality. 
There's a general tendency for the symptoms of borderline personality to remit over time. They don't remit in every instance, but oftentimes they do to some degree and some remit faster than others. The anger criterion is the slowest to remit over time, so it's the most stubborn in essence. This anger criterion is also associated with a number of negative outcomes. With the anger criterion endorsed we see decreased functioning in work and social settings, increased incidents of comorbidity with substance use disorders, increased suicidal behavior, increased impulsivity, and increased paranoid ideation. We also see that anger is related to rejection sensitivity and increased conflict and with individuals.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1830,"Childhood Maltreatment, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Psychopathy",2018-07-30,24663,884,46,"This video answers the question: What is the association between child abuse and neglect and antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy? Antisocial personality disorder is an official mental health disorder and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, but psychopathy is really an area that's studied that's similar to antisocial personality disorder. Childhood maltreatment (emotional, physical, sexual abuse, neglect) has been studied with its relationship to mental disorders a number of times and there is a link that's apparent between childhood maltreatment and anxiety and depression. There is also a relationship to personality disorders and specifically to antisocial personality disorder. With antisocial personality disorder, specifically we're talking about a diagnosis in the DSM, there needs to be at least three symptoms present from the symptom criteria and there's a few other criteria as well. The symptom criteria for antisocial personality disorder include repeatedly engaging in behavior that violates social norms, lying impulsivity, irritability and aggressiveness, disregarding the safety of others, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse. We also see three other symptom criteria: an individual must be 18 years of age or older, they must have had symptoms of conduct disorder before the age of 15, and the behavior from the symptom criteria can't exclusively occur during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Depending on the research we look at, we know that about 70 - 80%t of male prisoners meet the criteria for antisocial personality, but only 15 – 25% meet the criteria for what we refer to as psychopathy. Psychopathy is not a mental disorder, but it's an area that's studied and really psychopathy has a complex relationship with antisocial personality disorder. In general, what we see is some of the antisocial characteristics from antisocial personality disorder are present and psychopathy, like being reckless and there are other characteristics that are added. It's similar to antisocial personality disorder, but there are a few extra characteristics we look for including grandiosity, callousness, shallow affect, and pathological lying. In general, we would say that almost all individuals who would qualify as having psychopathy would have antisocial personality disorder, but many individuals who have antisocial personality disorder would not qualify as having psychopathy. We know that both of these constructs (antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy) are linked to childhood maltreatment.

1831,Loneliness and Borderline Personality Disorder,2018-07-28,64440,2390,141,"This video describes the loneliness aspect we see with borderline personality disorder. When we talk about loneliness and borderline personality disorder, we're talking about an experience that is fairly common for individuals with that diagnosis. When we look at the borderline personality disorder symptom criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, we won't see any symptom criteria that used the word loneliness, but rather we see a symptom criterion that says a chronic feeling of emptiness and usually that's the one we tie to this sense of loneliness. Sometimes we also tie in the fear of abandonment with this construct. Loneliness is really about a perception of social isolation and a feeling of being alone, but social isolation is a lack of interpersonal relationships. Social isolation and loneliness aren't exactly the same thing. One can be lonely without being socially isolated, but usually we do think of the two as strongly associated. Another way we can think of loneliness is that it is a perception of a difference between how many relationships somebody actually has and how many relationships that they desire. We could also look at it in a similar way: it's about the quality as well as the quantity of relationships. Loneliness is a construct that's associated with borderline personality disorder. Individuals with borderline personality disorder report higher levels of loneliness and social isolation. Loneliness has some severe consequences, whether it's associated with borderline personality disorder or not, including: higher morbidity with both mental and physical illnesses, and higher mortality. Individuals with borderline personality disorder report smaller social networks, so they have regular contact with a smaller number of people. Individuals with borderline personality disorder generally have the same number of people available to talk to, but impaired communication ability gets in the way.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1832,What is the Dark Triad?,2018-07-26,79090,2734,103,"This video answers the question: What is the dark triad? When we talk about the dark triad, we're talking about a theory that there are three specific personality traits that can come together to cause specific difficulties. These traits are narcissism, psychopathy, and a trait referred to as Machiavellianism. The idea with this theory is that all three of these traits share a personality trait called antagonism, which we could conceptualize as low agreeableness on the five-factor model. Narcissism, as it relates to the dark triad, has two different types: grandiose and vulnerable. With grandiose narcissism, we see traits like being dominant, arrogant, exploiting other people, and exhibitionism. With vulnerable narcissism, we see characteristics like being shy, distrusting other people, having mood lability, and being self-critical. Most of the research on the dark triad is really referring to grandiose narcissism and not vulnerable narcissism. With psychopathy, we see characteristics like violating social norms, being callous, having a lack of empathy, being impulsive, irresponsible, having superficial charm, being manipulative, and having shallow effect. When we look at the research that studies psychopathy related to the dark triad, we're really talking about a continuum where there can be subclinical psychopathy all the way up to clinical psychopathy. The last trait in the dark triad is Machiavellianism. We don't really see this mentioned in the clinical literature very much. This is really something we see more in literature related to careers. With Machiavellianism, we see characteristics like being manipulative, callous, being goal-oriented, having a satisfactory to a good level of impulse control, and tending to be related to white-collar crime or at least white-collar antisocial behavior. An important point with Machiavellianism is that there's no clinical impairment here with this particular trait.

1833,"Borderline, Comorbid Borderline and Substance Use Disorder, and Impulsivity",2018-07-24,8386,308,11,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between borderline personality disorder, borderline personality disorder with comorbid substance use, and impulsivity? When we talk about borderline personality disorder, we're talking about a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). There are a number of symptoms associated with borderline personality disorder like frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, and impulsivity in areas that are potentially self-damaging. We also know that substance use disorders have a connection with impulsivity. Borderline personality disorder is highly comorbid with substance use disorder. The research indicates that the relationship between borderline personality disorder, comorbid substance use, and impulsivity is not straightforward, partially because the way borderline personality disorder is defined in the DSM. It is important to understand the difference between risk-taking behavior and impulsivity and we need to work toward a clear definition of impulsivity, particularly as it relates to the diagnostic criteria and borderline personality disorder. If we understand impulsivity better, that will help us to more accurately diagnose this disorder.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1834,What is Psychopathy?,2018-07-23,234566,6921,74,"This video answers the question: What is psychopathy? When we talk about psychopathy, a lot of times we think of the diagnosis that we see in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: antisocial personality disorder. These two constructs, psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder, are similar and some would argue the really the same thing, but I usually think of them as distinct. I think the research supports this perspective fairly well. We could think of psychopathy as having all the characteristics we would expect to see with antisocial personality plus characteristics from other domains, specifically interpersonal and affective domains. To understand antisocial personality disorder we look in the DSM and we see that there are seven symptom criteria and then three other criteria. Of the seven symptom criteria, three would have to be met for a diagnosis. The seven symptom criteria are violating social norms, lying, impulsivity, irritability and aggression, disregarding others’ safety, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse. Those symptoms would have to be present since the age of 15. Then we have the other criteria. An individual has to be 18 years or older, evidence of conduct disorder would have had to have been present before the age of 15, and the symptoms of antisocial personality disorder can't occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We can see from this definition of antisocial personality it would be hard to conceptualize a presentation of psychopathy that didn't also qualify as antisocial personality disorder, and in fact this is how we usually think of it. We think of psychopathy as a subset of antisocial personality disorder, so that almost all of individuals who had psychopathy would qualify for antisocial personality disorder and a number of individuals with antisocial personality disorder would qualify for psychopathy, but not all of them. A number of the studies on antisocial personality and psychopathy look at male criminal offenders in the prison population. Here we see that around 70 – 80 % percent of those individuals qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, but only about 15-25% could be classified as having psychopathy.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1835,What is Emotional Switching with Borderline Personality Disorder?,2018-07-21,88772,2782,81,"This video answers question: What is emotional switching with borderline personality disorder? When we talk about the term emotional switching with borderline personality disorder we're talking about changing emotional states from positive to negative or from negative to positive. We would refer to changing within a type of emotional state (like negative to negative or positive positive) as simply emotional changing. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder (dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster). It's in the same cluster as antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders. There are nine symptom criteria for borderline personality (only five have to be met for diagnosis) including frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable and intense relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate intense anger or a difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation. We can see how a number of these symptom criteria could be connected to this concept of emotional switching. Again, changing emotions within the same polarity is not emotional switching. I'll just refer to this as emotional changing and the most common emotional changes that have been observed in the research are anxiety - sadness sadness - anxiety and anxiety – anger. All of these changes are within the negative polarity, so they're all moving from one negative emotional state to another negative emotional state. The probability that somebody would go from negative to positive or positive and negative in terms of emotional state is referred to as switching propensity. The size of the change is referred to as switching distance. Research has shown that emotional propensity is the same for those with BPD and those without it, but emotional distance is greater for those with BPD.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande

The nine symptom criteria are frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable or intense relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger, and paranoid ideation. We can see even if just five of these symptoms are met, this could interfere with a number of different types of relationships including romantic relationships. Interestingly, there haven't been many number of studies specifically on how borderline personality disorder is related to romantic relationships. One of the challenges here is that only about 20-30% of individuals with borderline personality disorder are dating, married, or cohabiting. Additionally, conducting research on couples is more difficult than conducting research on individuals.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande

1838,What is Seasonal Affective Disorder? (Major Depressive Disorder with Seasonal Pattern),2018-07-17,3918,159,19,"This video answers the question: What is seasonal affective disorder? When we talk about seasonal affective disorder, we're actually talking about something that's not technically a standalone mental health disorder, but it's actually a specifier of other disorders. The specifier is “with seasonal pattern.” This specifier is available to disorders like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar I Disorder, and Bipolar II Disorder. We usually think of it as most associated with major depressive disorder, but it may occur at about the same rate in individuals with bipolar disorder. Seasonal pattern occurs about 10-20% of the time with presentations of Major Depressive Disorder. For an individual to be eligible for a diagnosis that includes this specifier, they would have to meet the full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder, then the diagnostic criteria for seasonal pattern would be considered. Specifically referring to MDD, the symptoms of a seasonal pattern specifier include a temporal relationship between major depressive episodes and a particular time of the year, full remissions occur at a particular time of the year, in the last two years there have been at least two major depressive episodes that follow this temporal pattern and no non-seasonal major depressive episodes, the seasonal major depressive episodes substantially outnumber non-seasonal major depressive episodes over the course of the individuals lifetime. Those were the symptom criteria for seasonal pattern related to major depressive disorder, and the symptom criteria for seasonal pattern with bipolar disorder is close to the same, except it can also be a manic or hypomanic episode. In MDD with seasonal pattern we usually see symptoms of MDD that may be in one direction or the other, for example, with seasonal pattern we usually see low levels of energy, overeating, weight gain, hypersomnia, a craving for carbohydrates. With the spring and summer seasonal pattern we would more likely see a decrease in appetite, weight loss, anxiety, and insomnia. The prevalence of seasonal pattern with MDD tends to increase as individuals are farther away from the equator. There are several treatments for MDD with seasonal pattern including light therapy, medication, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). These treatment options as usually fairly effective.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1839,Narcissistic Rage and Vulnerable and Grandiose Narcissism,2018-07-16,20387,845,41,"This video answers the question: What is the relationship between narcissistic rage and grandiose and vulnerable narcissism? When we talk about the idea of narcissistic rage, we're talking about a reaction that takes place because of a mixture of shame, mistrust, and anger and usually this reaction is in response to criticism. Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are not official subtypes like we would see in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) for a narcissistic personality disorder, but rather different types of narcissism that have been observed and reported in the literature. Generally, we accept there is this difference between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. With grandiose narcissism, we see a tendency to exploit other individuals, a tendency to seem arrogant, self-promoting, and overconfident. With vulnerable narcissism, we tend to see someone who's self-critical, has a lot of mood instability, shyness, feelings of inadequacy, self-centeredness, insecurity, defensiveness, and resentfulness. We can see there's quite a few differences just there between these two types of narcissism. There is, however, overlap and generally the research tends to point toward a argumentative nature and an opportunistic nature as two areas that seem to be present in both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. Narcissistic rage has a relationship with these two types of narcissism. To understand this relationship, we have to look at a few of the other characteristics of these types of narcissism. With grandiose narcissism, we see this tendency to be assertive or dominant. Grandiose narcissism tends to be associated with higher levels of extraversion, like on the five-factor model of personality and we also see low levels of emotional distress and high levels of self-esteem. Vulnerable narcissism is associated with a tendency to complain, to feel bitter, lower levels of extraversion, high levels of emotional distress, and low levels of self-esteem. What really stands out here in terms of how it could relate to narcissistic rage would be the opposite finding in terms of extraversion, emotional distress, and self-esteem. Narcissistic rage is verbal and sometimes physical outbursts of violence. Usually, this is because of a perception of reality that's challenged. When looking at the characteristics of narcissistic rage, we see this tendency to retaliate and to have shame and depression during an episode of rage or shortly thereafter. It's also characterized by a lack of control, distrust, it can be worsened by high levels of shame or inferiority, and it tends to be reactive. With grandiose narcissism we see deliberate, purpose-driven aggression that's not reactive. It is self-enhancing and that tends to improve a sense of superiority. With vulnerable narcissism, we see that this is aligned quite well with the definition of narcissistic rage. You could make the argument that narcissistic rage is predominantly seen in vulnerable narcissism. The characteristics that we see with narcissistic rage like having distrust, it being worsened by shame and inferiority, and being reactive are elements of vulnerable narcissism and don't tend to be in grandiose narcissism.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1840,Countertransference in the Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorder,2018-07-14,8190,244,18,"This video answers the question: are there any complicating factors (e.g. countertransference) on the clinical side when treating narcissistic personality disorder? Complicating factors on the clinical side are variables that would affect a clinician that might impede or otherwise negatively affect the treatment of individuals with narcissistic personality disorder. This subject matter isn't really discussed a lot in a mental health treatment community. A lot of times there's this idea that mental health clinicians are immune from a lot of complicating factors, particularly the main complicating factor I'm going to discuss here today, which is countertransference. When we talk about countertransference, we first must understand transference. Transference is when a client has a certain type of feeling, thought, or behavior that they direct toward a clinician and this particular reaction was really created or reflects something that is related to somebody else. Transference is fairly common and really expected in clinical settings. Countertransference is when the clinician has feelings toward the client that are similar to what we see in transference. We often expand the term countertransference so it wouldn't necessarily have to be the way the clinician reacts toward another important person in their life, rather it could just be negative feelings, thoughts, and behaviors directed toward a client. Countertransference is generally considered to be negative. I mentioned there's this incorrect idea that counselors are immune from feelings of countertransference.  We know with narcissistic personality disorder that negative reactions are common from family friends and co-workers. A lot of times these negative reactions push individuals with narcissistic personality disorder into therapy in the first place. A number of individuals in the community that relate to people with NPD have these different negative reactions and of course clinicians do sometimes as well. There have been three sets of feelings and behaviors that were found with clinicians treating NPD, including feeling (1) demeaned belittled, unappreciated, angry, frustrated, and resentful, (2) indifference, boredom, distraction, and withdrawal, and (3) insecurity, incompetence, anxiety and feeling ineffective. Mental health clinicians are not immune from countertransference and there are a lot of different types of reactions one can have when working with an individual with NPD.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1841,Subtypes of Borderline Personality Disorder (Millon & Others),2018-07-12,16372,650,26,"This video answers the question: what are the types of borderline personality disorder? Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This is the dramatic, erratic cluster. In the DSM there are no subtypes listed for borderline personality, but we do see that in the literature there are a number of theories about possible subtypes of this disorder. I'm going to review a few of the lesser-known theories and then move to some of the more popular theories. We see that in a 2005 paper there were four different subtypes identified: high-functioning internalizing, histrionic, depressive internalizing, and angry externalizing. In 2008 we saw two papers that had subtypes listed including one that which was avoidant/obsessive compulsive, paranoid schizotypal, and histrionic narcissistic. Another 2008 paper that had high-functioning, aggressive-nonparanoid, and nonaggressive paranoid. In 2012, we saw a paper by Hallquist and colleague that has one of the models that I like the most. This paper had four subtypes: prototypical, poor identity-low anger, angry- mistrustful, and angry-aggressive. One thing I like about this 2012 study was they really went beyond the DSM criteria to model out these different subtypes. With all these different theories about subtypes that I've mentioned from different articles the most popular subtype example from Millon. Here we see four subtypes: discouraged, impulsive, petulant, and self-destructive. As you can see, there are a lot of different theories about what types of subtypes may exist with borderline personality disorder and some of them are fairly similar. It's not really clear that we have one model that is superior.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1842,What is Somatic Symptom Disorder?,2018-07-10,22959,711,37,"This video describes somatic symptom disorder. When we talk about somatic symptom disorder we're talking about a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It is in a section called “somatic symptom and related disorders,” so it's in the same section as other disorders like factitious disorder, conversion disorder, and illness anxiety disorder. The first symptom criterion is one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or cause significant disruption. Criterion B has a few symptom criteria under it and only one of these have to be met. Here we see excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to somatic symptoms or health concerns and at least one of the following three criteria would have to be met: disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of the symptoms, persistently high level of anxiety about health concerns or about the symptoms, and the third is excessive time and energy is devoted to the symptoms or to health concerns. Criterion C is that the state of being symptomatic is persistent. We think of this as usually more than six months. What is interesting here about criterion C is that the somatic complaint can change over the course of these six months. It doesn't have to be the same somatic complaint, but just the general state of being symptomatic would be persistent for six months. Somatic symptom disorder also has a few specifiers: with predominant pain, persistent, mild, moderate, and severe.  Some other characteristics we see with somatic symptom disorder include checking behavior, a need for continual reassurance, and avoiding physical activity. There is a variety of comorbidity we see with somatic symptom disorder including a number of medical disorders and mental disorders.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1843,What is Borderline Aggression?,2018-07-09,22310,958,44,"This video answers the question: what is the aggression that we see associated with borderline personality disorder? Aggression is defined as behavior directed toward another individual or other individuals with the proximate intent to cause harm. Anger is a feeling or an emotion, but aggression is really activity-based. We think of aggression as a core feature of borderline personality disorder. One of the symptom criterion for the disorder is inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger. That phrase “difficulty controlling anger,” that's where we would see the aggression. It's important to note here that aggression is not required for a diagnosis of borderline personality and neither is anger. When we think of aggression, we know that there are two main types: instrumental and reactive. Instrumental anger is planned and goal-directed. Reactive aggression, however, is triggered by provocation, threats, frustration, and has an association with negative emotion. The type of aggression we see most strongly associated with borderline personality is reactive versus instrumental. Reactive aggression, as we see it in borderline personality disorder, is associated with having relational dysfunction, predicts future aggression, is most present in close relationships (particularly romantic relationships), and we also see that's associated with intimate partner violence. 
There are several dimensions that are put forward as being related to reactive anger in borderline personality including: affective dysregulation, impulsivity, threat hypersensitivity, and empathic functioning. The ability to empathize is usually divided into cognitive empathy and affective empathy. What we see with borderline personality disorder is the cognitive empathy piece and this is the type of empathy where you can infer the mental states of other individuals. This tends to be decreased in individuals with borderline personality disorder. Interestingly, affective empathy, which is the emotional engagement part of empathy, is intact in most instances of borderline personality disorder. This is a bit of a surprising finding when we think of empathy and borderline personality disorder. We usually think of it in terms of a global deficit, which is a deficit in cognitive empathy and in affective empathy. It's also interesting to consider empathy and borderline personality disorder and comparing it to empathy and narcissistic personality disorder. Narcissistic personality disorder is also a Cluster B personality disorder. In narcissistic personality disorder we see that cognitive empathy tends to be intact and there's a deficit an affective empathy. It is interesting how these two personality disorders are different just in relation to empathy. The ability to empathize is compromised with both disorders, but in different ways.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1844,Are Narcissistic Personality Disorder Symptoms Stable Over Time?,2018-07-07,4473,159,22,"This video answers the question: is narcissistic personality disorder stable over time? Narcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder listed in a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Cluster B personality disorders, more so than Cluster A and Cluster C, tend to have symptoms that decrease in duration, frequency, and severity over time. There are nine symptom criteria and at least five need to be endorsed for diagnosis of NPD. The remission rate for NPD over a two-year period is over 50%, but for number of the symptoms, the prevalence stayed stable over that time. The categorical view of NPD saw quite a bit of remission, but a dimensional view did not. Having an over 50% remission rate may seem high when we look at NPD, but if we consider other personality sores that are featured in other studies, we see that it's not that unusual.  Borderline and avoidant personality disorders tend to remit at about that same rate and schizotypal and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder tend to remit at about a 60% rate. I'm going to go through the nine symptom criteria for narcissistic personality disorder and give the prevalence and then what was observed with that particular symptom. The prevalence is the percent of the sample that met that particular symptom criterion. The first symptom criterion for NPD is grandiosity. This particular criterion was prevalent 60% of the time initially and was relatively stable over the two-year period. It also had the third highest remission rate. The second symptom criterion is having fantasies of unlimited power and success. These were present over 70% of time in the beginning, they decreased quite a bit, and had the second highest remission rate moving. The third symptom criterion this belief that one is special or unique. This had the lowest prevalence at the beginning (about 40%) and it actually increased in terms of prevalence over the two-year period. This was the only symptom criterion to increase over the two years. The next criterion, which is the need for excessive admiration, was the most prevalent initially at over 80%. Excessive admiration appears to be a defining characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. The next symptom criterion is a sense of entitlement and the prevalence initially for this symptom criterion was over 50%. This was relatively stable over time. The next criterion is a tendency to exploit individuals interpersonally. The prevalence of this symptom criterion was over 70% initially and this was a symptom criterion with the highest remission rate. Next, we have a lack of empathy. A lot of times we think about narcissistic personality disorder, we think of a lack of empathy. This tends to be conceptualized as an important symptom criterion for this disorder. Its prevalence initially was over 40%, so it was not as common as a lot of the other symptom criteria. Lack of empathy was relatively stable. The next symptom criterion is envy.  The prevalence for this symptom criterion was over 70% and it was stable throughout the two years. That brings us to the last symptom criterion, which is appearing arrogant. This was prevalent half the time initially and was stable over the two years.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1845,What is Codependency?,2018-07-05,105074,3280,33,"This video answers the question: What is codependency? When we talk about the term codependency or codependence, we oftentimes think of the word “dependent.” Sometimes the term codependency becomes confused with dependency and specifically dependent personality disorder. Let's take a look at the definition of codependence. Codependence actually has a few different meanings and one is much more common than the other. The less common meaning would be any relationship where the level of dependence exceeds what is healthy. Under this definition, codependence isn't much different than dependence. The more common definition for codependence is in a relationship where one person has a substance use disorder, extreme personality traits (e.g. a personality disorder), or other mental disorders. The codependent party is the individual who is the caregiver to that person with the disorder. Codependence by itself is not a mental health disorder, so it's not in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). We see a lot of features with codependent behavior that line up with a number of diagnostic criteria across a number of mental disorders, but in and of itself codependence is not a disorder. It has a number of features including increased levels of anxiety and depression, decreased levels of trust, difficulty being assertive, need for control, boundary problems, concerns about abandonment, victims of abuse, and they tend to think that if they failed to provide the support that they do provide that everything would fall apart. This leads to a sense of being trapped. Another feature we see with codependency is that it feeds into a sense of identity. It becomes how person identifies. We could also think of this as creating a sense of purpose. If the symptoms of the substance use disorder remitted that would threaten the individual who's codependent in terms of their sense of identity and their sense of purpose. We also see a feature here with codependency, which is to protect the individual a substance use disorder from consequences. The individual who is codependent often tries to maintain things the way they are. They don't want change and fear of change is actually one of the features we see with codependency.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1846,What is Misophonia?,2018-07-03,48174,1878,147,"This video describes the construct of misophonia. Misophonia literally translates into “hatred of sound.” Misophonia is a condition, but not a mental disorder or any other type of disorder. It's something that's being studied, but it has not yet been classified. Misophonia is an aversive reaction to repetitive or pattern-based sounds. Sometimes it's referred to as selective sound sensitivity syndrome and sometimes it's also referred to as sound rage. With certain sounds, there would be a reaction with misophonia and this reaction could be autonomic arousal and a number of distressing feelings including anxiety, disgust, anger, or irritability. We could also see behavioral reactions with this as well, including avoidance or acting out on the feelings of anger. There's some debate as to what types of sounds would qualify under misophonia. One school of thought is that the sounds have to be directly related to the human body like breathing or chewing. Another theory indicates that it could be any type of repetitive or pattern-based sound. Some examples would include typing, whistling, foot tapping, or finger tapping, a clock ticking, an engine running, the sound of cars in the distance, stepping sounds or something like opening a plastic wrapper. The reaction to these triggering sounds is not necessarily proportional to the volume or the intensity of the sound. Loud sounds wouldn't necessarily cause a greater reaction or trigger a reaction as opposed to lower volume sounds. Misophonia is not an official disorder and it may actually be a symptom of another disorder. Misophonia tends to be comorbid with a number of other conditions and disorders including Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, a number of anxiety disorders, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).  There is no established treatment protocol for misophonia, although certain treatments have been attempted with mixed results. There's some indication that cognitive behavioral therapy may be somewhat effective in treating misophonia and there's also some research that indicates that exposure and response prevention may help a little bit. Some theories about treatment approaches have focused more on related symptoms to misophonia, like avoidance, anxiety, and anger. There are a number of treatment protocols already established for those feelings or behaviors.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1847,What is Mania and how is it related to Bipolar Disorder?,2018-07-02,78928,2290,65,"This video answers the questions: What is mania and how is mania related to bipolar disorder? A manic episode is not the same thing as bipolar disorder. Technically, a manic episode would almost always indicate some sort of mental disorder, but we don't know which one until we go through their criteria and then look at the criteria for different mental disorders. There are four main criteria for a manic episode and the second criterion (Criterion B) contains the symptom criteria. There are seven symptom criteria. Let's take a look at Criterion A. It indicates that a manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy. This must last a week and it must be present most of the day nearly every day, unless an individual's hospitalized, in that case there's no time limit. Taking a look at criterion B, which is the criterion that contains the symptom criteria for a manic episode. It also supplies additional information about how to evaluate those symptoms. It indicates that three or more of the seven symptoms are required for a diagnosis or four or more are required if we only see an irritable mood only. If there is an expansive mood an elevated mood combined with the irritable mood, it would still be three or more. We also see other information here, which is that the symptoms must be present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior. Taking a look at the seven symptom criteria in Criterion B we see increased self-esteem or grandiosity, a decreased need for sleep, an individual is more talkative than usual, a flight of ideas or racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or increased psychomotor activity, and excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences. Criterion C says that this must cause marked impairment and criterion D indicates that the effects of substances or a medical condition can't be what is causing these symptoms. 
Bipolar disorder has two symptom criteria. The first one (Criterion A) is the presence of a manic episode. Criterion B indicates the manic episode can't be better explained by the presence of another mental disorder including schizoaffective, schizophrenia, schizophreniform, and delusional disorder as well as other related psychotic disorders. There could be another explanation for a manic episode other than bipolar disorder. Another interesting point with the definition of bipolar disorder is there's no mention in the criteria about the presence of a major depressive episode, yet we almost always think of bipolar disorder as having both manic and major depressive episodes. It's important to recognize that delusions are fairly common with mania even though they're not one of the symptom criteria. Delusions are present in about 75% of manic episodes. Another note relates to irritable mood. Irritability in mania tends to increase over the course of a manic episode. A manic episode could start with elevated or expansive moves without irritability, but we may see the irritability later on in that same manic episode. Also, irritability tends to increase if the goal-directed activities are interrupted.",Jul,Dr. Todd Grande
1848,Do Personality Disorders Change over the Lifetime?,2018-06-30,12740,632,55,"This video answers the question: “Do personality disorders improve, worsen, or stay the same as people age?” When we talk about personality disorders and how they change over time, it's important to recognize that the prevalence of personality disorders in the general population is around 10-15%. This prevalence rate is stable across all of the age categories. We conceptualize personality disorders as extreme personality traits and we conceptualize personality traits as being relatively stable over time, so it would make sense to think of personality disorders as being stable over time. If an individual is diagnosed with a personality disorder in early adulthood, it wouldn't be surprising that they would still have symptoms when they are in middle age and older age. To understand the course of personality disorders, it's important to understand the onset of personality disorders as they're conceptualized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). In the DSM there are ten personality disorders and for each of these ten personality disorders the symptoms would have had to been present before or during early adulthood. This means there is no such thing as a late onset personality disorder if we're going strictly by what's in the DSM. Then ten personality disorders are divided into three clusters: A, B, and C. Cluster A contains the odd, eccentric personality disorders: paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal. Cluster B contains the dramatic, emotional, and erratic personality disorders: antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorder. Cluster C is the anxious, fearful cluster: avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. When we look at the research that is available and we look at the progression of personality disorders over time, we know that for Cluster A personality disorders the prevalence tends to increase with age and the severity, frequency, and duration of the symptoms also tends to increase by a small amount. With Cluster B personality disorders the prevalence decreases with age and the symptom severity, frequency, and duration also decrease. With cluster C personality disorders, we see an increased prevalence with age and we see an increase and severity, frequency, and duration with age.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1849,What is Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features?,2018-06-29,17556,583,36,"This video describes major depressive disorder with mixed features. Major depressive disorder MDD with mixed features is a disorder with a specifier. There are a number of specifiers available with MDD, and mixed features is just one of them. This is one of the more controversial specifiers we see with major depressive disorder. It's also a specifier available for bipolar disorder. This specifier is often missed and this set of symptoms is oftentimes misdiagnosed as well, because it's easy to confuse with bipolar disorder. Whenever we use a specifier with a disorder, the full criteria for the disorder have to be met first and then there are additional criteria for the specifier. In the case of mixed features there are a number of additional criteria. There are a number of different potential symptoms and an individual has to have three or more of those symptoms to qualify for the first criterion. Criterion A contains the symptom criteria. These different symptom criteria need to be present nearly every day during the majority of days of a major depressive episode. In Criterion A we see elevated or expansive mood, grandiosity or increased self-esteem, talkativeness or having pressured speech, a flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased energy and goal directed activity, engaging in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences, and a decreased need for sleep. Criterion B notes that this behavior is observable and represents a change from the usual behavior. Criterion C indicates that if the full criteria for mania or hypomania is present then the diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be made. Again, this mixed feature specifier is often confused with bipolar disorder. Criterion D says the symptoms are not attributable to substances. There are several characteristics associated with mixed features that make it different than what we might see with other specifiers or MDD without any specifiers. We see that mixed features are a significant risk factor for developing Bipolar 1 or Bipolar II disorder. We know that oftentimes with Bipolar Disorder, an individual who has that disorder would have started with a major depressive disorder diagnosis. We also know that mixed features aren't rare. About 25 to 40% of individuals with major depressive disorder would qualify for the mixed features specifier. Oher characteristics associated with the mixed features specifier include: increased risk for suicidal behavior, increased use of substances, a poorer response to treatment, an increased number of major depressive episodes, and an earlier age of onset of major depressive disorder.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1850,What are the Associated Characteristics of Narcissistic Personality Disorder?,2018-06-28,41455,1703,71,"This video describes the associated features of narcissistic personality disorder. When we talk about narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), we're talking about a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Cluster B personality disorders are considered dramatic, emotional, or erratic. There's NPD and there's also antisocial, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders. NPD has symptoms like grandiosity, a sense of entitlement, having fantasies of a great amount of power or success, envying people we're believing the people envy you, and being arrogant. Here, I'll be going over some of the subtle signs that are associated with NPD and these don't necessarily align with any of the symptoms in the definition for NPD. Some subtle signs are pathological lying, anger in response to criticism, low self-esteem, comorbidity, blame other people when something goes wrong, being a poor listener, and the tendency engage in extramarital affairs. 
General description of NPD:
Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with unlimited success, feeling too special to be understood by regular people, needing excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, being interpersonally exploitative, having a lack of empathy, being envious and others and believe others are envious of them, and being arrogant. Oftentimes an individual with Narcissistic Personality Disorder wants to be recognized as superior, believes they are so complex and amazing that they can only be understood by special people, has low self-esteem, devalues the contributions of others, and is condescending. Criticism is not well received by most people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Comorbid disorders include other personality disorders (e.g. Antisocial Personality Disorder), Anorexia Nervosa, and substance use disorders (especially cocaine use disorder). The prevalence of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is about 1%. Common goals in mental health treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorder include adjusting behavior to improve relationships, developing skills resolve employment and career issues, and increasing insight. Clinically significant distress is required for a diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder as stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1851,What is Pathological Lying? (Pseudologia Fantastica),2018-06-26,88182,3137,133,"This video describes pathological lying. When we talk about the term pathological lying, we're talking about a set of symptoms that appears to be distinct, although there's controversy about that.  Currently, it is not a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, but the construct has been studied for a number of years and has a few different names including: compulsive lying, mythomania, morbid lying, and pseudologia fantastica. I'm just going to refer to it as pathological lying. There are three main schools of thought in terms of where pathological lying fits in with mental health. First is that it's a distinct mental disorder and it should be classified as such. With this school of thought, pathological lying is just overlooked. The second school of thought is that it is distinct and it could qualify to be a mental disorder, but it does not impair functioning or it's not treatable. The last theory is that the symptoms may or may not be distinct, but they're really just behaviors that are part of other disorders, specifically Cluster B personality disorders (antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic. Pathological lying is a construct for which there is no agreed-upon definition. What are some of the characteristics of pathological lying? We see repeated lying that takes place over the course of years and it becomes a regular habit. The primary motivation does not appear to related to social status, material gain, or be otherwise obvious. The reason for the lying seems to be without purpose. This set of symptoms appears to be chronic and impulsive. A lot of the lies seen with pathological lying are fantastical, but not beyond the realm of what's possible. Pathological lying behaviors can also co-occur with normal lying. Lying that's there to avoid consequences or to be altruistic. We also see that the lying and pathological lying may be a reward in itself. There may be an internal motive for telling the lies. People affected by pathological lying don't always recognize their own behavior. In a sense it can be self-deception as well as an attempt to deceive others. Sometimes it's described in the literature as a daydream or a fantasy that's communicated as true. Instead of an internal daydream or fantasy, individuals who demonstrate pathological lying behaviors communicate these day dreams and fantasies to other people. Eventually they could come to believe in the lies, at least in a sense or they could forget what the truth really is. There's a part of pathological lying that in some instances appears to border on delusional. Other possible motives for pathological lying behavior include to repair an unimpressive narrative. If pathological lying is a distinct mental disorder that simply had been overlooked, there are a number of theories about how these behaviors are different as they manifest in Cluster B personality disorders. For example, if we compare pathological lying to antisocial personality disorder, with antisocial personality disorder, oftentimes the motive would be for some sort of profit. There would be no guilt associated with the lie. With pathological lying, there usually is guilt associated with the lies. In essence, one of the reasons that someone could start to believe the lies would be to reduce feelings of guilt. When we compare pathological lying to narcissistic personality disorder, we see that with NPD there would be a purpose of being grandiose. A number of individuals with NPD believe they are already perfect and that's not really a behavior we see with pathological lying. Comparing pathological lying to borderline personality disorder, a lot of times of with borderline personality disorder the lies have a purpose of avoiding abandonment and sometimes individuals with this disorder falsely accuse other people to avoid rejection or to reject them. There is mood dysregulation tied in with some of the lying behavior in borderline personality that we wouldn't see with pathological lying. Histrionic personality disorder has an attention-seeking component that we don't think is a part of pathological lying.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1852,What is Quiet Borderline Personality Disorder?,2018-06-25,125071,4207,113,"This video describes the construct “quiet borderline personality.” Borderline personality disorder is in cluster B of the personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). In this definition in the DSM, we do not see any subtypes. When we talk about quiet borderline, we're not talking about a formal term or subtype and we're not even talking about a construct that's technically supported by research. We don't really find a lot of information about quiet borderline in the research. There are some other terms that are used instead of quite borderline and certainly the argument can be made that they're similar, for example, the discouraged type we see in Millon's subtypes. We can think of quiet borderline personality disorder as running on a few different continuums. The first one would be obvious to subtle. I would think of quiet borderline personality as having many more subtle characteristics as opposed to obvious characteristics. Another continuum you could use here would be externalizing over to internalizing. I think of quiet borderline personality order as really having more internalizing components as opposed to externalizing components. There are also a number of other associated characteristics that I view as being more consistent with this idea of quiet borderline personality than to what I'll refer to as regular or typical borderline personality. Some of these traits include the traits we see with dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder, a decrease in the level of assertiveness, and an increased likelihood of being misdiagnosed. Some of the potential other diagnoses that we might see instead of quiet borderline personality disorder would be major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, other personality disorders, and anxiety disorders. Other associated features of quiet borderline personality could also be shame and self-hatred. Also, I think of quite borderline personality disorder as less associated with anger and aggressiveness and more associated with a desire to avoid conflict.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1853,What is the Difference Between Borderline Personality Disorder and Histrionic Personality Disorder,2018-06-23,374503,8669,199,"This video describes difference between borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder are in cluster B of the personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Cluster B is the dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster. With Histrionic Personality Disorder, we see there are eight symptom criteria and at least five are required for a diagnosis: being uncomfortable when one is not the center of attention, inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior, rapidly shifting and shallow emotions, using one's physical appearance to draw attention, an excessively impressionistic style of speech that tends to lack detail, an exaggerated expression of emotions, being suggestible, and regarding relationships as more intimate than they really are. With borderline personality disorder, we see there are nine symptom criteria, but again five or more are required for a diagnosis: making frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, having an unstable relationship cycle (this is a cycle of idealization and devaluation), identity disturbance, impulsivity, suicidal behavior, affective instability, a feeling of emptiness, constant anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms. When looking at the similarities between these two disorders, we can see there are quite a few they share in many cases: the rapidly shifting emotions, the strong emotional expressions, the attention-seeking behavior, impulsivity, and the tendency to be manipulative. Characteristics we would expect to see with borderline personality disorder in many cases, but not see with histrionic would include: anger, feelings of emptiness, self-destructive behavior, and the identity disturbance. Characteristics we would expect to see with histrionic personality disorder and not often see with borderline personality disorder would include: being suggestible, impressionistic style of speech, and inappropriate sexually seductive and provocative behavior. Adding to the difficulty in differentiating these two disorders is the fact that they are comorbid about 10 to 15% of time. There are also other factors to consider when trying to differentiate these two diagnoses. One is the debate over whether histrionic personality disorder a distinct set of symptoms or just a variant of borderline personality disorder. There are many researchers in the mental health treatment community that believe that histrionic is a variant and should not be a separate diagnosis. I think this belief actually has an effect on how mental health disorders are diagnosed. I think there's this tendency to overlook histrionic personality disorder and to diagnose borderline personality disorder. There's more information available about borderline personality disorder than histrionic in terms of the course of the disorder, treatment, and in the number of articles written about borderline personality disorder. There are a lot of reasons why a clinician may be biased to diagnose borderline personality disorder. This bias wouldn't have to be deliberate, but rather this could be an unconscious bias.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1854,Complicating Factors for Treatment of Antisocial Personality Disorder,2018-06-21,24197,729,38,"This video describes complicating factors related to treating antisocial personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual under Cluster B, which dramatic, emotional, and erratic cluster. Antisocial personality disorder is in the same cluster as narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms including: continually engaging in behavior that would be grounds for arrest, lying, impulsivity, irritability and aggression, disregarding individual safety, being irresponsible, and showing a lack of remorse. In order to qualify for this diagnosis an individual has to be at least 18 years old and symptoms of conduct disorder would have had to been present before the age of 15. Also, the symptoms can't exclusively appear during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Oftentimes when we talk about the treatment of antisocial personality, we hear this term “complicating factors.” There's this idea that treating antisocial personality disorder is difficult for a variety of reasons and evidence supports that this is true. Now there are a number of reasons why this is the case and I'm going to go through a number of those reasons. The first one we'll look at is the tendency of Cluster B personality disorder to have less severe symptoms as individuals grow older. When we look at personality disorders in general, we know that Cluster A and Cluster C personality disorders tend to stay the same as individuals age or sometimes they get slightly more symptomatic. Cluster B personality disorders are the personality disorders that tend to improve a little bit over time. Another element is that the comorbidity associated with antisocial personality disorder is challenging. Oftentimes individuals who have this disorder have comorbid substance use disorders and comorbid personality disorders, particularly the ones we see in Cluster B (narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic). This confuses what's actually being treated and what's actually responding to the treatment in terms of symptom characteristics. Consider an individual who has antisocial personality disorder and substance use disorder, who is treated, and the substance use disorder improves. Sometimes that presentation is recorded as an improvement overall, even though the antisocial personality disorder characteristics may not have improved at all. Another complicating factor is how improvement itself is measured. We know that with antisocial personality disorder, a number of individuals with this disorder who received treatment or court-ordered to do so. Depending on the research you look at, about 50 to 70% of male prisoners meet the full criteria for antisocial personality disorder. In the criminal justice system, the interest may not be to try to improve all of the symptoms we see with antisocial personality, but specifically symptoms related to criminality. Common treatment goals in prison settings, for example, would be reducing the likelihood that somebody would reoffend, aggression, decreasing substance use, and decrease impulsivity Another complicating factor with antisocial personality is a lack of motivation. The last complicating factor I'll cover here is the relationship between mental health clinicians and clients who have antisocial personality disorder. Some of the characteristics we see associated with antisocial personality disorder can create bias on the side of the mental health treatment community including: lack of empathy, arrogance, being opinionated, being cynical, and being callous. These behavioral factors and a lack of experience and lack of training on the part of some mental health clinicians can result in the mental health clinicians being biased, fearful, or discouraged about how effective treatment will be. This complicating factor, as well as all the other complicating factors, in terms of how we treat antisocial personality disorder are unfortunate because we know that antisocial personality disorder does seem to respond to treatment in some instances.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1855,Cognitive Behavioral Strategies for Narcissistic Personality Disorder,2018-06-19,70061,2420,141,"This video describes how cognitive behavioral therapy may be applied to treating narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). NPD is a Cluster B personality disorder found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Cluster B contains personality disorders that are considered dramatic, emotional, or erratic including narcissistic, antisocial, borderline and histrionic personality disorders.
The potential symptoms with NPD are grandiosity, a tendency to have fantasies that involve a lot of power or wealth, feeling special, needing excessive admiration, feeling entitled, tending to exploit people, having difficulty empathizing with other individuals, having envy for other people and believing that other people would envy them, and an attitude of arrogance or pretentiousness. In the mental health treatment community, narcissistic personality disorder tends to have elicit strong reaction. I think there are a variety of reasons for this. One is that oftentimes an individual with NPD who begins therapy will challenge or insult a clinician and there's this tendency to be defensive, which really only makes things worse. This is one of these points where experience and maturity on the clinician side can really help. The highest probability of changing NPD, or any other personality disorder, would be with a long duration of treatment. Even with a long duration of treatment, symptoms may not change, but certainly I'm not aware of any brief therapy that can claim any meaningful level of effectiveness with narcissistic personality disorder. Another factor to remember when treating NPD is a lot of times when individuals with NPD come into treatment, it's because of a crisis or another set of symptoms. We commonly see major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, substance use disorders, and anxiety disorders. Also, there are comorbid personality disorders to consider including the other cluster B personality disorders and paranoid personality disorder. We know that with NPD insight is often a problem, so it's unusual to hear somebody with NPD refer to the world as being problematic. NPD might have a protective element to it. The behaviors might protect a fragile sense of self, so if a clinician tries to take away that protective mechanism especially right away, that might not be a good idea. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) centers on cognition, affect, and behavior. The approach targets each one of these separately and brings them together at different levels. When we consider a potential strategy for treating NPD and we recognize the low level of insight, it makes sense not to challenge the client's worldview directly, but rather point out that behavioral changes may have a plus side. What's interesting about going after the behavioral side first is that it doesn't require the client to acknowledge that there's a lack of awareness or insight. It doesn't require them to acknowledge that they might be missing something. It doesn't require them to realize that other people may not be the problem in situation, but rather just to change the behavior.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1856,"What is the ""Fear of Abandonment"" Associated with Borderline Personality Disorder?",2018-06-18,49473,1798,53,"This video describes the fear of abandonment we see associated with borderline personality disorder. When we look at the definition of borderline personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual the DSM, we see that there are nine criteria at least five have to be met for a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Criterion one states “frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment,” and that's what we're referring to here when we say fear of abandonment. Fear of abandonment is sometimes referred to as autophobia, however, autophobia technically is a fear of being alone. Most of the time we think of these as the same thing, but technically they're not synonymous. It's also important remember that a fear of abandonment is not technically required for diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. There are nine symptom criteria and only five are required. None of the symptom criteria are mandatory. Usually with borderline personality disorder, we do see that this criterion is endorsed. The fear of abandonment can also stand alone or be related to another disorder. Somebody could just simply have a fear of being abandoned or it could be a symptom of dependent personality disorder or separation anxiety disorder. It doesn't necessarily have to be related to borderline personality disorder. We think of this fear of abandonment as being a cornerstone to borderline personality disorder and being connected to the other symptoms in many cases. This fear of abandonment is often related to a romantic partner, but it doesn't have to be. It can also be a friend, a member of the family, and it can even be a mental health clinician. This fear of abandonment can be triggered by any number of circumstances, for example: actual abandonment, rejection, the cancelling of plans, and being late.
These frantic efforts can contribute to or lead to the other symptoms we see in the definition for borderline personality disorder. This is one symptom and there are eight other criteria. In clinical presentations, we often see these frantic efforts most directly related to the unstable intense relationship pattern, impulsivity in ways that can be potentially self damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, anger, and paranoid ideation. So that only leaves two other symptom criteria: identity disturbance and a feeling of emptiness. Sometimes we see these frantic efforts tied to those symptom criteria as well. It's not uncommon to see these efforts in a form that really aren't read directly related to the symptoms of borderline personality like stalking, calling excessively, or texting excessively. These frantic efforts are a form a self-fulfilling prophecy. An individual with borderline personality disorder that meets the symptom criterion will often drive romantic interest or friends or family away because of this intense fear of abandonment. This fear of abandonment can lead to a cycle that's distressing and results in a number of symptoms and functional impairment.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1857,Six Myths about Narcissistic Personality Disorder,2018-06-16,17335,722,42,"In this video I review six myths about narcissistic personality disorder, which I refer to as NPD. 
Myth number one is that individuals with MPD are deliberately harmful. NPD can be conceptualized as an individual with this disorder protecting a fragile sense of self by seeking the success of admiration. They can't fulfill their needs internally and they look externally but in a destructive way so this behavior has a purpose, but it's not necessarily deliberately harmful. It may be harmful as a byproduct of this protective mechanism.
Myth number two is that individuals with NPD have extremely high self-esteem or self-confidence. I actually think the opposite is true. Individuals of this disorder tend to have low self-esteem and low self-confidence, they just appear to have high self-esteem and high self-confidence. We could look at the behaviors with NPD as being compensatory. 
Myth number three is that individuals at NPD are highly competitive. Sometimes we see highly competitive behaviors with individuals with NPD, but because defeat can be so detrimental because, often times they avoid direct competition with other individuals. 
Myth number four is that individuals NPD view themselves as better at everything or better than everyone. A lot of times they have a superior attitude, but they also acknowledge that other individuals have superior traits. Sometimes what they do here is they identify with those individuals. They believe that those individuals can understand them in a way that other people cannot. 
Myth number five is that criticism is helpful to a person with NPD. Criticism may be helpful under certain circumstances, but often times criticism can be devastating and lead to feelings of depression and anxiety. 
Myth number six is that NPD is easy to spot right away. I actually think the opposite is true. Initially, individuals with NPD present as confident, productive, charming, maybe as an expert in their field, but over time we see that that's oftentimes not the case. NPD is persistent and over time the characteristics will become more visible, however, in the short run, this disorder is not always easy to spot.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1858,What is Melancholic Depression?,2018-06-14,43116,1405,41,"This video describes melancholic depression. When we talk about melancholic depression and we look at the DSM, we can see that what we're really speaking of is a specifier named “with melancholic features.” This specifier can be assigned to several different disorders including major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Melancholic depression is not a distinct diagnostic classification, rather a specifier we see with other disorders. In order for an individual to have that specifier assigned to a primary diagnosis, they'd have to meet the full criteria for that diagnosis and then additional criteria for the ‘with melancholic features” specifier. The most severe part of the current major depressive episode is what we're looking at to apply the symptom criteria. The criteria are divided into two parts: A and B. For Criterion A, one of two symptoms is required: loss of pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to stimuli that would usually be pleasurable. Criterion B contains six symptoms and at least three are required. Number one is a depressed mood characterized by profound despondency or despair. Number two is depression that is worse in the morning. Number three is early morning awakening. Number four is marked psychomotor agitation or retardation. We oftentimes see this one endorsed when someone has melancholic depression. Number five is significant weight loss or anorexia. Number six is inappropriate or excessive guilt. There are specific characteristics that are associated with melancholic depression outside of what we see in the symptom criteria. We know that melancholic depression is more likely to occur in individuals who are having a severe major depressive episode. It's also more likely to occur in inpatient populations as opposed to outpatient. Individuals with melancholic depression were more likely to have a trauma history. The concept of melancholic depression is not without controversy. It's been studied for quite a bit of time and it's been assigned a number of names throughout the different research studies that have been published about it including: melancholia, psychotic depression, typical depression, and endogenous depression, autonomous depression, and core depression.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1859,Nine Myths about Schizophrenia,2018-06-13,23220,957,34,"This video describes nine myths about schizophrenia. 
Myth number one: Schizophrenia is a rare mental disorder. Schizophrenia affects about 0.3 to 0.7% of the population and schizoaffective disorder affects another 0.3% of the population. Schizophrenia might not be as common as a number of other mental disorders, but it is by no means rare.
Myth number two: Schizophrenia is the same thing as split personality. I think this comes from the origin of the term schizophrenia which means “split mind,” but actually schizophrenia really has nothing to do with split personality or split mind. 
Myth number three: Schizophrenia is the same thing as severely and persistently mentally ill (SPMI). There is some overlap between these two terms but SPMI covers the effects of mental disorders, not specifically any particular mental disorder. Usually we think of SPMI as encompassing schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and sometimes antisocial personality disorder. Someone who is categorized as severely and persistent mentally ill may have schizophrenia, but they also may have other mental disorders.
Myth number four: Individuals with schizophrenia are violent. There is a slight increase in risk of violence associated with schizophrenia and also associated with a few other mental disorders, like bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. This isn't a dramatic increase in risk, just a slight risk and we see more of the risk around the psychotic phase of these mental disorders. We see the greatest risk and if a substance use disorder is comorbid with schizophrenia. 
Myth number five: Schizophrenia is really just a fear of the government. When we look at the themes of the delusions that occur with schizophrenia, a fear of the government is a popular theme, but there are many other types of presentations of schizophrenia that don't involve paranoia. Someone can have a fear of the government and a fear of being spied on and that can be completely unrelated to schizophrenia.
Myth number six: Schizophrenia is caused by dysfunctional or abusive parents. Specifically, we see with this myth the idea that schizophrenia is caused by an overprotective or abusive mother. This comes from an old term referred to as the schizophrenogenic mother and that later expanded to the schizophrenogenic family. This theory was really based on this idea that somehow a mother or a family could cause schizophrenia through certain behaviors. The term schizophrenogenic means to cause schizophrenia. We know from research that there is no such thing as the schizophrenogenic mother or the schizophrenogenic family. There are environmental contributors to the development of schizophrenia, but parenting is not a substantial contributor.
Myth number seven: Schizoaffective disorder is a more severe version or type of schizophrenia. I can understand why this myth persists. If we look at schizoaffective disorder, it has the features of schizophrenia plus major mood disturbances like mania or depression. It kind of makes sense that we would think of schizoaffective as being more severe, but actually schizoaffective disorder is often not more severe than schizophrenia. The prognosis for schizoaffective disorder is actually a little bit better than the prognosis for schizophrenia.
Myth number eight: Schizophrenia is caused through genetics only. There is a substantial genetic contribution to the development of schizophrenia, for example, if somebody has an identical twin who has schizophrenia there's a 40 - 65% percent chance that that individual will develop schizophrenia themselves, but that leaves a lot of other possible causes to schizophrenia. We call these environmental causes, like stress, exposure to trauma, and other different elements. There is a genetic contribution that is strong in schizophrenia, but that's not all that causes this disorder.
Myth number nine: Schizophrenia is not treatable. There are various treatments available for schizophrenia including talk therapy and medication. Usually, we see talk therapy and medication combined when treating schizophrenia. There's a lot of different research about what type of recovery pattern we could expect with schizophrenia. Overall, we know that about 25% of individuals with schizophrenia will experience significant improvement and about 50% will experience mild to moderate improvement of their symptoms. That leaves 25% that really don't see much improvement at all, which is unfortunate. We need to work harder in terms of research about schizophrenia to improve the treatments available. That leaves 75% that do improve significantly or improve somewhat, so schizophrenia is treatable.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1860,What is the Course of Major Depressive Disorder?,2018-06-12,18261,754,35,"This video describes the course of major depressive disorder over the lifetime. When we talk about major depressive disorder we're really talking about an episodic or cyclical mental disorder. It's not merely excessive sadness or some sort of state that's maintained that's relatively stable over time, but rather the illness cycles. One of the characteristics of major depressive disorder is the major depressive episode. We can think of major depressive disorder as being made up of one or more major depressive episodes. With major depressive disorder, we'd expect to see either depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure. At least one of those two symptoms must be present and we'd also expect to see a number of other symptoms including potentially a difficulty with sleep, difficulty concentrating, a change in appetite, feelings of worthlessness, feelings of inappropriate guilt, fatigue, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior. If the full criteria for a major depressive episode are met, then an individual would have major depressive disorder. The 12-month prevalence for MDD is 7% and the onset can be at any age. The course of MDD is highly variable. We see a lot of different types of presentations. In order to understand the course, it's important to understand the idea of remission. Remission is a two-month period where there are no symptoms of major depressive disorder or one or two symptoms, but the expression of those symptoms is mild. some individuals will develop a major depressive episode and they'll never have a two-month period when there are no symptoms or a few symptoms. We refer to this as “chronicity.” Major depressive disorder can be chronic and we also see presentations where there are long periods of remission, but then the major depressive episodes come back. We refer to this as “recurrence.” Some individuals will develop major depressive disorder by having a major depressive episode, but they'll only have one episode and they'll never be a recurrence. That episode will end and the remission will just stay in place. Most the time, however, we do see recurrence. If an individual has a single major depressive episode there's a 60% chance that they'll go on to have a second major depressive episode. If they have two major depressive episodes, there's a 70% chance that they'll have three. If they have three, there's a 90^ chance that they'll have a fourth. We also have data available on the likelihood of a recurrence after a major depressive episode. After an MDD ends there's a 40% chance of a recurrence within two years, a 60% chance of a recurrence within five years, and an 85% chance of recurrence within 15 years. The average length of a major depressive episode is about four months, if that MDE is untreated.
When we look at the course overall in terms of major depressive disorder we see that over time major depressive disorder doesn't really change that much. The likelihood of suicide attempts tends to drop and middle-life and later-life, but the likelihood of a completed suicide does not change as people grow older. We also know that a number of people who were initially diagnosed with MDD will eventually be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Roughly 20% of individuals with MDD will eventually be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and the risk of that conversion from MDD to bipolar disorder increases with early onset MDD.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1861,What is Splitting with Borderline Personality Disorder?,2018-06-11,59776,2103,52,"This video describes “splitting” in the context of borderline personality disorder. When we talk about the concept of splitting and borderline personality disorder, it's important to recognize that splitting is a nonspecific term. Splitting is either a cognitive distortion or a psychodynamic defense mechanism, depending on how you conceptualize it, but either way the concept of splitting is related to dichotomous thinking. Splitting not the same thing as the symptom criterion in borderline personality disorder that refers to unstable and intense relationships. These types of relationships are an example of splitting, but we can also see other types of splitting behaviors with borderline personality disorder. I'm going to be talking about splitting as it refers to that symptom criterion: a pattern of unstable and intense relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation. I'm going to refer to this idealization devaluation cycle as the love-hate cycle. There are some characteristics that are specific to this particular symptom criterion or characteristic that we oftentimes see in conjunction with the symptom criterion. With this love-hate cycle, we oftentimes see that it's related to just one person at a time, and often a new relationship. Another characteristic of this love-hate cycle is that it can continue even when the relationship is over. Even though we think of this love-hate cycle as an example of splitting, sometimes we see ambivalence with this particular symptom criterion, so it's really focusing more on the unstable an intense relationship component and we don't always see the extremes of idealization and devaluation clearly defined. This is particularly the case in the devaluation phase of this cycle. Another characteristic specifically of the devaluation phase and the idealization/devaluation cycle is that it tends to be triggered by a fear of abandonment. The devaluation phase tends to co-occur with a lot of the other symptoms.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1862,What is Atypical Depression?,2018-06-09,27760,915,27,"This video describes atypical depression. When we talk about the term atypical depression, what we're usually referring to is a specifier referred to as “with atypical features.” This specifier is available for major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. This is not a subtype of these disorders, but rather a specifier, so it adds more information to the diagnosis. In order for the with a typical features specifier to be added to a diagnosis, separate criteria have to be met in addition to the criteria necessary for that primary diagnosis. The symptom criteria for the specifier need to be present the majority of days in the current or most recent major depressive episode, or in the case of persistent depressive disorder, just in the course of persistent depressive disorder. Criterion A is mood reactivity and this is required. This is when someone feels a little bit better when they hear good news. In Criterion B there are four symptom criteria and at least two have to be met: significant weight gain or an increase in appetite, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Criterion C is the symptoms for with melancholic features and with catatonia cannot be met. The atypical depression specifier can't exist at the same time as melancholic features or catatonia. Atypical depression is actually not that unusual. It affects about 15 to 40% of individuals with major depressive disorder and about the same percent of individuals with bipolar disorder. There are some characteristics that are associated with atypical depression that we don't see with major depressive disorder with another specifier or without any specifiers. For example, certain personality traits tend to be more common in atypical depression, like the traits seen with borderline, histrionic, and avoidant personality disorders. With atypical depression we also see an increase risk of suicidal behavior and increased comorbidity with other mental disorders.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1863,Do the Symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder Change with Age?,2018-06-07,29038,1141,49,"This video describes how borderline personality disorder sometimes changes as individuals grows older. In the research on borderline personality disorder, there is this debate about whether the symptoms that we see in the DSM the definition tend to improve. We see these mixed results in the research, but there's some agreement over some of the symptoms. For example, generally it's agreed upon that impulsivity tends to decrease markedly as an individual moves into their 30s, 40s, and even more so into the 50s and 60s. We also see increased functioning around career and the relational style that we see with borderline personality seems to change as individuals with borderline personality disorder grow older. They tend to have better relationships, although one theory explaining this suggests that avoidance actually increases, so the relational difficulties aren't as evident because the individual is avoiding relationships altogether. We also see a decrease in identity disturbance and the characteristics of interpersonal relationships that we see a borderline personality of being entitled and being demanding tend to decrease as an individual grows older. Other changes we tend to see include less self-harm, fewer suicidal behaviors, less rule breaking, and a lower level of emotional turmoil. 
Other symptoms and other characteristics of borderline personality disorder tend not to change too much or if they do change they change fairly slowly. These would include anger, feelings of emptiness, mood dysphoria, fear of abandonment, lack of empathy, the tendency to use manipulation, and selfishness. What is all this information about possible symptom changes of borderline personality disorder tell us about the course of borderline personality? It appears that some symptoms tend to improve and other symptoms tend to stay the same, so does this mean that overall borderline personality or tends to improve as an individual grows older? That could be happening, but there's another theory around these potential symptoms changes. The DSM criteria for borderline personality may not be sensitive to how borderline personality disorder presents as people age. This could be really more a factor of these symptoms expressing themselves differently in older individuals as opposed to younger individuals. This is just one theory about what's happening with borderline personality as individuals age. This area deserves more research and more attention.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1864,What is Illness Anxiety Disorder?,2018-06-06,35914,945,58,"This video describes illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is a mental disorder where an individual is preoccupied with concerns about having a serious illness. This is an interesting disorder because it's fairly similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder and there's even a debate in a mental health community about whether or not illness anxiety disorder is really just a variant of OCD. When we look at the criteria for illness anxiety disorder, there's another interesting feature. A lot of mental disorders in the DSM have a symptom criteria section and then other criteria, so there may be nine symptoms in the symptom criteria section and somebody might have to meet four or five of those symptoms to qualify for that criterion. There is no section in the DSM with illness anxiety disorder that has a number of symptoms where somebody only has to meet a certain number less than that for the diagnosis. For example, if we consider borderline personality disorder. It has nine symptoms in the symptom criteria, but an individual only needs to have five of those to qualify for that diagnosis. Again, with illness anxiety disorder, all the symptoms are required. The first symptom is a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. The DSM doesn't specifically say that this would be a mental disorder or a medical disorder, but most of the time we interpret this as relating to a possible medical disorder. This first criterion being related to medical disorders brings up an important point in terms of the distinction between a talk therapist and a physician. For example, I have a PhD in counselor education and supervision and I'm a licensed counselor. I'm not a physician and most talk therapists are not physicians either. With this particular diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder, as a talk therapist you would be working with somebody who has complaints or concerns about a medical disorder, so it's important to make the referral to a physician so that you know if they, in fact, have the disorder or don't. The second criterion is that there are little or no somatic symptoms. The third symptom criterion is the individual is experiencing a high level anxiety about health-related concerns. The fourth is that there's excessive health-related behavior like checking or maladaptive avoidance. A lot of times when we think of this disorder and compare it to OCD, it's this particular symptom criterion that makes it difficult to distinguish between the two. The fifth symptom criteria is that the disturbance has been present for six months, but the illness that the person is worried about can change in that time. A lot of times when we think of illness anxiety disorder, we think of one particular illness that the person is worried about having or acquiring. Sometimes with this disorder, if they have evidence that shows that they don't have a particular medical disorder they were worried about then they might develop a fear about another potential medical disorder. The illness can change, but the disturbance would be present for at least six months. The sixth symptom criterion is that this disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1865,"Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Conduct Disorder, & Antisocial Personality Disorder",2018-06-05,38001,1283,47,"This video describes oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), and antisocial personality disorder (APD). With ODD we see there eight symptom criteria. An individual would need to have four of these symptom criteria to be considered for a diagnosis of ODD and there are a couple of other criteria as well. In terms of symptom criteria, four out of eight are required and these are in three categories: anger irritable mood, argumentative defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. When we look at conduct disorder we see there are fifteen symptom criteria and an individual would have to have at least three of these symptoms. There are four categories: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, lying or stealing, and what the DSM refers to as “serious violations of rules.” A couple of examples here would be truancy or repeatedly staying out overnight without parental permission. Conduct disorder also requires clinically significant impairment, but not clinically significant distress. If an individual is 18 years or older, they can't meet the full criteria for antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder are mutually exclusive. ODD and conduct disorder are not mutually exclusive. An individual can be diagnosed with both ODD and conduct disorder at the same time. When we look at antisocial personality disorder, we see there are seven symptom criteria an individual would have to have at least three. Here we see repeatedly engaging behavior that is grounds for arrest, lying, impulsivity, irritability or aggressiveness, a disregard for the safety of others, irresponsible behavior, and a lack of remorse. For an individual to have APD they have to be at least 18 years or older and evidence of conduct disorder would have to have been present before the age of 15. This is an interesting symptom criterion, because this isn't saying that individual has to have a diagnosis of conduct disorder in order to be diagnosed with antisocial personality order later on, rather this is saying that evidence of symptoms of conduct disorder had to have been present before the age of 15. The last criterion for APD is that the symptoms aren't exclusively observed during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
When we look at the relationship between these three disorders, we usually conceptualize O D as the least severe, with conduct disorder being the next most severe, and antisocial personality disorder being the most severe. We know that ODD is a significant risk factor for developing CD, and we also know that CD is a significant predictor of developing APD. There are a few different features of conduct disorder that make it much more likely that we would see an eventual development into antisocial personality disorder. For example, if the subtype of conduct disorder is the childhood onset subtype, which is where one symptom is present before the age of 10, that would increase the risk of developing antisocial personality disorder later on. Also, there is a specifier “with limited prosocial emotions,” that would also increase the risk of developing APD. In terms of the potential progression from ODD to CD to APD, there are a lot of different percentages out there in terms of what percent of individuals with ODD would move on to have CD and what percent of people with CD would move on to have APD. Even though there's some variability in the research in terms of the percentages, in general, the progression of ODD to CD occurs about one third of the time. We can say the same thing when looking at conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. About one of every three individuals with conduct disorder will eventually develop antisocial personality disorder. We can calculate that one out of nine presentations of oppositional defiant disorder will eventually go on to develop antisocial personality disorder. That is one-third times one-third. There is speculation in the mental health treatment community and the research community that really these three disorders are simply manifestations of the same underlying disorder that are dependent on someone's age. We don't know this for sure, however, this is just one of the theories that's out there. Understand the relationship between ODD, CD, and APD informs clinical treatment and further research on these disorders is warranted.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1866,Nine Myths about Borderline Personality Disorder,2018-06-04,46825,1808,110,"This video describes nine myths of borderline personality disorder. 
Myth number one is that all presentations of borderline personality disorder look the same. What this myth is really saying is that if we see one presentation of borderline personality disorder we've seen them all. There are a number of reasons why this myth is not true. First of all, each individual is unique so each presentation is going to be unique. Also, if we look at the symptom criteria for borderline personality we see that for a diagnosis of this disorder an individual has to have at least five of nine symptom criteria. If we do the math here in terms of combinations, we see that there are 256 possible combinations, because it's not just the five out of nine in terms of the combinations it's also six out of nine, seven out of nine, eight out of nine, and of course somebody could have all nine symptom criteria. If you add up all those combinations that's 256 combinations without counting differences in severity, duration, and frequency, and of course without counting possible comorbid mental disorders and other factors. Another important point to make with this myth is that if you look at the symptom criteria, you can see that two individuals could have borderline personality disorder and only share one symptom.
Myth number two is that a diagnosis of borderline personality can only be provided to an individual who is 18 years or older. This is the case with antisocial personality disorder, however it is not the case with borderline personality disorder. 
Myth number three is that borderline personality disorder only affects females. There are more diagnoses of borderline personality into females as compared to males. About 75% of the diagnosed presentations of borderline personality disorder are with females, but recent literature shows us that borderline personality disorder may affect females and males at the same rate.
Myth number four is that borderline personality disorder is easy to diagnose. There are a lot of complicating symptoms that make it difficult to diagnose borderline personality disorder. As with diagnosing any mental disorder, appropriate assessment takes time, clinical skill, and should be approached with caution
Myth number five is that borderline personality disorder is rare. Actually, borderline personality is fairly common. We don't know the exact prevalence, but research indicates that it's somewhere under 2% all the way up to almost 6%. It affects about 10% of individuals in outpatient mental health care and about 20% of individuals in inpatient mental health care.
Myth number six is that borderline personality disorder is always caused by trauma. We don't know if trauma causes any of the presentations of borderline personality, although it does seem fairly clear that there's some connection there. Certainly, it's a risk factor and it may be a causal factor, but we just don't know. Even if we want to assume it is an etiological factor, we know that about 10 – 20% of individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder don't have any trauma history at all. This idea that all borderline personality disorder is caused by trauma this is a myth.
Myth number seven is that an individual with borderline personality disorder is dangerous. There's a slight increased risk of violence with borderline personality disorder and other personality disorders, but it's quite small. Sometimes it's made worse by mixing substances in with the disorder. 
Myth number eight is that for borderline personality disorder to be treated effectively, it must be treated by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). This simply isn't the case. We know that DBT appears to be as effective as other treatment modalities when it comes to borderline personality disorder, but it's also impractical sometimes because it's thought of as a program only type of treatment. In most cases it can also be quite expensive. The problem with this myth is that it allows somebody to see DBT as the only potential effective treatment and therefore they would overlook other treatments, which have been shown to be equally as effective. DBT is an important treatment, but it's not the only treatment. 
Myth number nine is that borderline personality disorder cannot be treated at all. We know this isn't true. A number of modalities can be effective in many cases we see with borderline personality disorder. There are a lot of variables that go into how effective any particular treatment will be with a specific individual including level of insight, motivation, how much family support is available, the duration, frequency, and severity of the symptoms, and comorbid mental disorders.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1867,The Course of Bipolar Disorder,2018-06-02,30806,1434,50,"This video describes the course of bipolar disorder. When we talk about bipolar disorder, we're talking about a disorder characterized by the occurrence of manic episodes. These are periods of time when mood is elevated. We also see major depressive episodes, which are periods of time when mood is depressed or low mood. We consider bipolar disorder to be a chronic disorder, so usually after onset somebody will have symptoms on and off for the rest of their life. In some cases, bipolar disorder remits, but most the time we consider this to be chronic. With some mental health disorders, it's expected that a symptom of that disorder or several symptoms of that disorder would be present every day or most days in a week. Bipolar disorder is unusual in the sense that is has manic episodes and oftentimes depressive episodes and they are markedly more severe than what we see the rest of the time. Usually between episodes most individuals will have symptoms, but they're not as severe as what we see during the manic episodes and the major depressive episodes. 
In terms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorder, we think of hypomania as being associated with bipolar II disorder, because that's one of the main differences between those two disorders, but actually someone with bipolar I disorder will likely experience more hypomania than somebody with bipolar II disorder. This seems counterintuitive because hypomania is so critical to the definition of bipolar two disorder. We know that a number of manic episodes also start with a period of hypomania, so hypomania can lead into mania with bipolar I disorder. Symptoms of bipolar disorder are often present between episodes, although usually not as severe. We call these “residual symptoms.” With bipolar II disorder, we know that the periods between episodes tend to be shorter and the major depressive episodes tend to be longer. There's also a greater probability with bipolar II disorder that rapid cycling will develop. Rapid cycling is when there's four or more episodes in one year. Rapid cycling is associated with less favorable treatment outcomes. When comparing bipolar II disorder to bipolar I disorder, often times people think it's a less severe version, but as you can see it's really not. It's different than bipolar I disorder, but it's not less severe. With bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder, we know that suicide risk is high. It is about 15 times greater than the general population for bipolar I disorder and the research is mixed in terms of bipolar II disorder, but the latest research indicates that the suicide risk for bipolar II disorder is about the same as bipolar I disorder. We also know with bipolar I disorder with mania, there's an increased risk of violence during that time and suicide and self-harm is included in that violence. The research tells us that the greatest risk of suicide with bipolar disorder is when there is a major depressive episode or a mixed episode. We believe a lot of that risk with the mixed episode comes from the combination of depressed mood and high energy and restlessness. Both bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder are chronic in nature. Both are severe disorders and both carry significant suicide risk. They necessitate mental health treatment. Bipolar disorder in general tends to respond fairly well to treatment particularly if the treatment continues throughout the lifetime.",Jun,Dr. Todd Grande
1868,Five Myths about PTSD,2018-05-31,24790,997,52,"This video describes five myths of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Myth number one is that any event can count as a trauma when diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder. I think part of this myth is this idea of over-pathologizing. The idea that the DSM is really too broad and pretty much any event can count as a trauma. If we look at the qualifying trauma area of the definition of PTSD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, we see that it is appropriate in terms of what types of events. 
Myth number two is that with PTSD comes a higher risk of violence now in order to understand why this is a myth you really have to understand that PTSD often times does not occur in isolation of other mental health symptoms particularly substance use disorders seem to come occur with pts a lot of times we think the PTSD symptoms come back first and then as a way of managing those symptoms sometimes people turn to substances so when you look at PTSD as a whole yes there is an increased risk of violence with post-traumatic stress disorder but when you control for other comorbid mental health disorders like substance use disorders and other mental illnesses PTSD doesn't carry any increased risk of violence 
Myth number three is that when a traumatic event occurs the symptoms are always immediately evident. We know that sometimes the symptoms come about fairly quickly after a trauma. There's even another disorder called acute stress disorder, which is really designed to deal with these symptoms. For an individual to have posttraumatic stress disorder the symptoms would have to be present for one month or more. The symptoms of PTSD can occur months after trauma and sometimes even years after a trauma. This is called “delayed expression,” and even though it's not particularly common we do see it once in a while. 
Myth number four is that traumatic exposure through television or pictures doesn't count as a qualifying trauma. Work-related exposures would count as part of this definition. 
Myth number five is that a diagnosis of PTSD can occur immediately following a trauma. There's another disorder called acute stress disorder. When we see symptoms of PTSD immediately after a trauma oftentimes we're looking at acute stress disorder and not posttraumatic stress disorder. By definition, a diagnosis of PTSD cannot be given until at least one month after a traumatic event.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1869,Examples of Narcissistic Personality Disorder Symptom Manifestations,2018-05-29,642581,15384,513,"This video describes Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with unlimited success, feeling too special to be understood by regular people, needing excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, being interpersonally exploitative, having a lack of empathy, being envious and others and believe others are envious of them, and being arrogant. Oftentimes an individual with Narcissistic Personality Disorder wants to be recognized as superior, believes they are so complex and amazing that they can only be understood by special people, has low self-esteem, devalues the contributions of others, and is condescending. Criticism is not well received by most people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Comorbid disorders include other personality disorders (e.g. Antisocial Personality Disorder), Anorexia Nervosa, and substance use disorders (especially cocaine use disorder). The prevalence of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is about 1%. Common goals in mental health treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorder include adjusting behavior to improve relationships, developing skills resolve employment and career issues, and increasing insight. Clinically significant distress is required for a diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder as stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's important to remember that NPD is a serious mental health disorder and necessitates treatment. Although we know that a lot of times when people have MPD they do not come in for treatment. A number of the treatments that we see for NPD are somewhat effective particularly if people stay in treatment for a long period of time. We know of course that NPD is a personality disorder and we expect the symptoms to be chronic and long-lasting, so getting sufficient treatment sometimes involves a longer duration of treatment. Also, it's important remember that we think of NPD as being protective. It's a mechanism we believe comes about, in part, to protect a fragile sense of self. People with NPD are genuinely suffering even though they may not realize why or they may not even realize they have a disorder. When working with NPD, as is the case when working with any mental disorder, it's important as mental health professionals that we show compassion and try to deliver effective treatment.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1870,Opinions about the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM),2018-05-28,14285,471,45,"This video describes my opinion of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, specifically the DSM-5. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual is a classification manual. It has mental health disorder classifications in it and it's used by members of a variety of professions. It's written primarily by psychiatrists and published by the American Psychiatric Association, but it's also used by mental health counselors, psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, as well as other mental health professionals. I'm going to go over what I like about the DSM, some criticisms I have of the DSM, and I'm also going to address some criticisms I've heard from others about the DSM. First, I'll talk about what I like about the DSM. Overall, I'm a fan of the DSM. I think it's generally well organized, it tends to use precise language, and I generally find it to be helpful. I like the way the DSM incorporates current research into the different classifications. Our field is subjective, so of course this is can be limited and we are talking about a complex subject matter, but I think that the DSM does a good job in this area overall. I have a few criticisms of the DSM. It doesn't appear to be a particularly collaborative document in terms of the way it was developed. The development process could be more transparent. I know that there are others that will argue that it was collaborative and it was transparent but I disagree. I realize that it's published by the American Psychiatric Association as I mentioned most of the authors are psychiatrists, but it is used by a number of other professions so it seems reasonable that all the different groups should have some ability to really contribute to what we see in the DSM. Another criticism I have is the way the sections are organized. Although I generally like it, they're not standardized, for example, you can see comorbidity listed in a number of classifications, but not in others. If this information isn't available then list it in the DSM, but specify “unknown.” That helps us to know what areas we need to continue to research. One of the most popular criticisms is that it over-pathologizes the population. It makes too many people eligible for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. Here I have to disagree. I understand that some of the wording and some of the way the classifications are structured could lead to overdiagnosis. You could also argue that some of the language and structure could lead to underdiagnosis. This criticism of the DSM is not about the DSM as much as it is about clinical practice. How the DSM is used is up to a practitioner and doesn't necessarily speak to the quality of the document itself. I think that one of the problems we have with diagnosing in the mental health treatment community is really about clinical skill and judgment and not about how correct or incorrect the DSM is. As clinicians it's our responsibility to look at the DSM and make our own judgment about how reliable or valid the classifications are. I think that the DSM has done a reasonable job in terms of the way it's structured the classifications, and I don't think it's really leaning toward over-pathologizing or underdiagnosing. Another criticism is there are no treatments indicated in the DSM. This is simply a matter of what the DSM is supposed to do. It's a manual full of descriptions of mental disorders and it's not designed to directly inform treatment by providing the treatments right there in the same document. It's designed to inform treatment by allowing us to accurately classify psychopathology and then we can look to the literature and see what treatments would be applicable. Overall, I tend to like the DSM. I think that the way it's arranged makes sense, although of course it could use improvements. I understand there are many others with different opinions and a lot of times with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual there are strong opinions in both directions. I believe that continued research can help future versions of the DSM become more helpful for our work and mental health treatment.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1871,Text Therapy vs. Traditional Face-to-Face Therapy,2018-05-26,2342,96,24,"This video compares text therapy with traditional face-to-face therapy. The idea of written communication and its relationship with therapy is not new, and the idea of specifically using texting isn't new. When comparing text only therapy or the text therapy portion of this online therapy to traditional face-to-face therapy, it's important to recognize a lot of these companies do use licensed therapists and I think this idea was designed with the best intentions in mind. Taking a look at the pros of text therapy, one of the key advantages as I understand it, would be convenience. Text therapy could reach people who otherwise would not engage in mental health treatment. As far as some of the disadvantages, I have a number of concerns about this particular modality. The first is the potential that it could actually delay treatment. Another disadvantage here with text therapy is we don't know how effective it is or isn't. We know that the therapeutic relationship, at least the part that could develop from a face-to-face encounter, is removed from text-only therapy. We also know the therapeutic relationship tends to predict a lot of success in therapy. Another disadvantage and concern with text therapy is the idea of how we manage risk and safety concerns, especially if a client is anonymous. A lot of times with these text therapy services the client is anonymous. 
A reasonable interpretation of the evidence we have available right now suggests that the effectiveness of text therapy has not been established. We don't know if text therapy is as effective as traditional therapy or as effective as no treatment at all.
What do I think of text therapy at this moment? I see it as supplemental. I think in certain situations it works well to supplement other face-to-face traditional modalities, where it's legal, ethical, and appropriate to do so. I don't think it's really standalone modality. I like the integration of technology and mental health treatment and I like that this modality was developed with good intentions. I don't text therapy as a substitute for traditional face-to-face therapy. rather I view it as a separate product. We simply need more research about how effective it is as well as a number of the other concerns that I have and other people have with text therapy. I think that when evaluating the evidence regarding text therapy, it is appropriate to be cautious.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1872,What is the Difference Between Schizoid Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder?,2018-05-24,22774,790,28,"This video describes the difference between schizoid personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. These two personality disorders don't have a lot of comorbidity. If an individual has one of these personality disorders they're not particularly likely to have the other. The cluster for schizoid personality disorder is Cluster A and for antisocial personality disorder is Cluster B. Schizoid personality disorder we have seven symptom criteria: does not want close relationships, being solitary, having little or no interest in sexual activities with another person, getting pleasure from only a few different types of activities or sometimes no activities, lacking close friends, being indifferent to praise or criticism, and having a cold, detached, or flat effect. With antisocial personality disorder we also see seven symptom criteria: violating society's norms (engaging in behavior that would be grounds for arrest), lying, being impulsive, being irritable or aggressive, disregarding the safety of others, being irresponsible, and having a lack of remorse. Sometimes the word “antisocial” is interpreted as not wanting anything to do with society or with relationships, but it really means against society, so it's an active mental health disorder. In terms of the symptom characteristics, somebody is actively committing crimes, manipulating, lying, being irresponsible. We can think of schizoid person is order more as asocial, just not having any interest in society. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder typically don't want to do anything to harm society and they're not engaging behaviors that are destructive to society. They just want to be separated from society. That's why we often hear the term “loner” associated with schizoid personality disorder.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1873,What is Secondary Traumatic Stress?,2018-05-24,26048,808,37,"This video describes the concept of secondary traumatic stress. It's important to understand that secondary traumatic stress is way that somebody can develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or meet the full criteria of posttraumatic stress disorder. There are a lot of other terms that mean something similar or even the same as secondary traumatic stress. For example, compassion fatigue is generally thought of as an interchangeable term. We also see vicarious trauma, which is similar but it's not really exactly the same thing. There's more of a cognitive component to vicarious trauma. Sometimes we hear the term burnout, but burnout applies to a phenomenon that affects individuals from every field, not just individuals who hear details of traumatic experiences. Somebody can burnout in part due to secondary trauma, but it's a separate construct. Secondary traumatic stress by itself is not a mental health disorder. The mental health disorder associated with it would be posttraumatic stress disorder. Secondary traumatic stress can affect mental health professionals, and that's the group I'm really talking about here in this video, however, it can also affect individuals from other fields like first responders and medical professionals. To understand secondary traumatic stress its first important to understand the first part of the definition of posttraumatic stress disorder as we see in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, (DSM). This is the section that contains a qualifying trauma. We know from the DSM in order for an experience to qualify as a traumatic event it must be related to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. It also must meet one of four symptom criteria in that same section: directly experiencing a traumatic, witnessing a traumatic event happening to somebody else, learning about traumatic event that occurred to a close family member or close friend as long as that traumatic event was violent or accidental, and experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of a traumatic event. If a mental health professional provides services via video conferencing and they're not face-to-face with the client, this still qualifies under criterion for because it's work-related. The consequences of secondary traumatic stress include impairment, distressing memories, dreams, flashbacks, hypervigilance, difficulty concentrating, negative beliefs, negative emotional states, difficulty sleeping, and avoiding reminders of a traumatic experience. This last symptom in particular is quite easy to connect because you could picture a mental health professional who just doesn't want to hear any more details about a trauma, so therefore they're not really available to listen to the client as would be most helpful. These symptoms don't just have a cost in terms of suffering for the mental health professional, they can also impair counseling or therapeutic performance. There are many forms of self-care that can address some of these symptoms we see with secondary traumatic stress and posttraumatic stress disorder including adjusting the work schedule, or adjusting what types of presentations somebody works with, and seeking mental health therapy.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1874,Seven Myths about Antisocial Personality Disorder,2018-05-22,44400,1744,64,"This video describes 7 myths about antisocial personality disorder. 
Myth number one is that all individuals with antisocial personality disorder are violent. This myth is popular is because the way that individuals with antisocial personality are portrayed in movies and on television. There is an increased risk of violence associated with antisocial personality but it's really only a moderate risk when you compare it to how its portrayed in the media.
Myth number two is that antisocial personality disorder is positively correlated with intelligence. There is no positive association between antisocial personality disorder and intelligence. 
Myth number three is that antisocial person I disorder is related to psychosis. I think one of the reasons that this myth is perpetuated is because of the word “psychopathy.” It sounds a lot like the word “psychosis,” but those are two totally different constructs. Some individuals with antisocial personality or may have psychosis, but it's not related to the personality disorder. They might have a separate disorder like schizophrenia or some other disorder that has psychotic features. 
Myth number four is that individuals in the high social personality disorder were born that way. We know that about 30 – 50% of the variance and the symptoms of antisocial personalities order can be explained by genetics, but the remainder would be caused by the environment. 
Myth number five is that individuals of the antisocial personality disorder don't know the difference between right and wrong. They may not in certain situations but again this has nothing to do with the antisocial personality disorder.  Many individuals with the disorder do know the difference between right and wrong, but they choose not to act on that knowledge.
Myth number six is that individuals with antisocial personality are free from all emotional expression. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder have a wide range of both positive and negative emotions including anger and anxiety.
Myth number seven is that antisocial personality disorder is the same thing as psychopathy. These are two different constructs. Antisocial personality disorder is primarily defined by behaviors, whereas psychopathy is defined largely as a personality construct. Another related myth to this myth is that antisocial personality disorder is the same thing as sociopathy, but again sociopathy is a different construct.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1875,Summary of all 10 Personality Disorders,2018-05-21,198131,7520,189,"This video summarizes the ten personality disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).
Paranoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of suspiciousness and distrust of others. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder will often question the loyalty of others, believe others are trying to harm them, and are reluctant to confide in people. They sometimes see demeaning aspects in benign comments and behaviors. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder tend hold grudges and have difficultly forgiving perceived wrongs. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder who are married tend to question the fidelity of their partners. 
Schizoid Personality Disorder is characterized by detachment, being a “loner,” no interest in forming relationships, a deficit in social skills, taking jobs that isolate them from others, no close friends, decreased interest in pleasurable activities, indifference to praise or criticism, cold or flat affect. Clinically significant distress is not required for a diagnosis of Schizoid Personality as stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Individuals with Schizoid Personality Disorder rarely seek treatment, however, the prevalence is about 3 – 4%. 
Schizotypal Personality Disorder is characterized by ideas of reference, odd beliefs, unusual perceptions, odd thinking or speech (e.g. elaborate, metaphorical, vague), paranoid ideation, inappropriate and constricted affect, peculiar behavioral appearance, lacking close friends, and social anxiety. Both disorders are characterized by lack of close friends and unusual affect.
Antisocial Personality Disorder is characterized by repeated acts that violate the norms of society, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, verbal and physical aggression, reckless disregard for the safety of others, irresponsibility, lack of remorse, and lack of empathy. The characteristics typically associated with Antisocial Personality Disorder in prison settings are superficial charm, lack of empathy, inflated self-appraisal. The prevalence of Antisocial Personality Disorder is about 3% of males and 1% of females. About 70% - 80% of males in prison may have Antisocial Personality Disorder. 
Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms including a fear of abandonment, a series of unstable relationships, self-identity changes, stress-related paranoia, risky and impulsive behavior, suicidal behavior or threats, mood swings, empty feelings, and anger. One of key features of Borderline Personality Disorder is the idealization/devaluation cycle, sometimes called the love/hate cycle. 
Histrionic Personality Disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms including wanting to be the center of attention, sexually seductive behavior, rapidly shifting and shallow emotions, an effort to gain attention through physical appearance, impressionistic speech pattern, self-dramatizing, exaggerated emotional expressions, theatrical, easily influenced, and believe relationships are more intimate than they really are. Individuals with Histrionic Personality Disorder tend to struggle with relationships and sometimes seek treatment from depressive symptoms from losing relationships. The prevalence of Histrionic Personality Disorder is about 3%. 
Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with unlimited success, feeling too special to be understood by regular people, needing excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, being interpersonally exploitative, having a lack of empathy, being envious and others and believe others are envious of them, and being arrogant. Oftentimes an individual with Narcissistic Personality Disorder wants to be recognized as superior, believes they are so complex and amazing that they can only be understood by special people, has low self-esteem, devalues the contributions of others, and is condescending. 
Avoidant Personality Disorder is characterized by fear of social situations, social inhibition, panic attacks, isolation, low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and feelings of inferiority. Avoidant personality disorder is a cluster C personality disorder (anxious fearful cluster). In that same cluster there is dependent personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder, like any personality disorder, is usually thought of as long lasting and pervasive. 
Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) is characterized by a pattern of maladaptive preoccupation with details, orderliness, efficiency, and perfectionism. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder symptoms include not completing work tasks and strained interpersonal relationships.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1876,What is the Relationship between Mental Health Disorders and Violence?,2018-05-19,11093,313,41,"This video describes the relationship between mental disorders and violence. Oftentimes, when there's a violent act that's covered by the national media, there's this association made between that act and the presence of a mental disorder or more than one mental health disorder. Does science support this? What does the research literature tell us about mental disorders and the relationship to violence? Let's start with public opinion. There are a number of surveys that look at what the public believes about mental health disorders and violence and we know that from a 2013 survey, 46% of the public indicated that they believe an individual with a mental health disorder is far more dangerous than a member of the general public. We know from other surveys that 35% of the public believe an individual with a mental health disorder is likely to be violent. Specifically, when talking about major depressive disorder, 32% of public believes that an individual with major depressive disorder is more likely to be violent, and 60% of the public believe that an individual with schizophrenia is more likely to be violent. We know from the research literature that if we look at the construct of mental health disorders in general, there's only a slight increase in violent risk for an individual with a mental health disorder versus a member of the general population. A lot of that risk is focused on just a few mental disorders. With mental disorders, there is no difference in the risk of violence. For a few mental health disorders there is, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and some of the personality disorders, and many of the substance use disorders. If the association between mental health disorders and violence is so weak, what is causing all the violence that we see? Violence is a complex problem and there are a number of risk factors. No single risk factor is a cause. There's a difference between something that's causal and something that's a risk factor. Some of the risk factors we know about would be a history of violence, being exposed to violence as a child, age, gender, stress, crisis, substance use, socioeconomic status and a number of other factors that did not mention. The incorrect assertion that mental health disorders are somehow strongly linked with violence only makes it so that individuals with mental disorders don't want to come forward and seek treatment. They understandably don't be thought of as somebody that's a higher risk for violence. This misrepresentation is doing real damage in terms of the ability of the mental health treatment community to reach those in need.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1877,Examples of Schizotypal Personality Disorder Symptom Criteria Manifestations,2018-05-17,115646,3875,264,"Ideas of reference: ideas of reference become easily confused with psychosis, hallucinations, and delusions of reference. With this term it really comes down to two things: an unusual connection between unrelated events (sometimes this involves confused cause and effect and sometimes it's just taking two events that have nothing to do with one other and connecting them. An example might be an individual with this disorder may be driving along and see a big sale on car tires and then later on they may see a news story where an accident occurred and it was caused by tire failure. They may connect those two by thinking that the place that was selling the tires was adding new tires and therefore other tires had to fail. There's no reason those two events would be connected, but they might make that connection anyway. Another example of an idea of reference is when an external event has some sort of special meaning to individual and this is above and beyond just being reminded of something. An example here would be say an individual with this symptom was watching television and it was a television show where people were exercising. They might think that's a special message to them or that their lack of exercising caused that television show. 
Odd beliefs or magical thinking: One of the examples we see from case studies and from the literature is a real commitment to the idea of paranormal activity. There are a lot of people that do not have schizotypal personality disorder that believe in the paranormal, but it's really the degree to which that belief influences the person's life and the degree to which it's applied by that individual. For example, if they believe that ghosts are all around us and they take certain precautions not to anger the ghosts or not to encounter the ghosts and this is something that interferes with functioning, that would be really more consistent with this symptom criterion than simply someone believing in the paranormal. The magical thinking oftentimes involves the individual believing they have control over other people's minds and this is linked to the ideas of reference. An individual may be in a supermarket and see somebody select a particular item off the shelf and they may think that they caused that by thinking about that item.
Unusual perceptual experiences: This symptom is easily confused with psychosis and hallucinations. We may see this manifested through an individual hearing someone whisper their name or hearing somebody whisper something and that person is not there. Another example of this is when an individual feels like someone is in the room with them they sense the presence of another human being even though there's no one in the room. 
Odd thinking or speech: With this one we may see someone creating new versions of a word, so using a word and a way it wasn't intended. One way to think about this is turning a verb into a noun or an adjective into a verb. Another feature we may see is when an individual is extremely abstract in the way they speak. 
Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation: This symptom is similar to what we see with paranoid personality disorder and what we see sometimes with schizophrenia. This can manifest a number of ways like somebody can be concerned about infidelity or they can believe that they're being followed. 
Inappropriate or constricted affect: A lot of times we see this in the form of eye contact, like when somebody makes too much eye contact too little where or they have a blank stare. We can also see this in terms of the expression of emotions, for example, if throughout a conversation someone is smiling and laughing even though the content isn't funny or upbeat. We may also see a decrease in emotional reactivity, so if someone is telling a sad story a depressing story and the individual does not react. 
Behavior or appearance that's odd, peculiar, or eccentric: This takes on many different forms. An example could be if an individual wears all the same color all the time, for example, if they always wear black regardless of the context or wear heavy coat even though it's warm outside. Another example of this is wearing many layers of clothing particularly if the layers don't progress in a way that we would normally think as logical, for example wearing undergarments on the outside. 
Lack of close friends: Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder typically don't have close friends. If they do have a close friend, oftentimes it's a first-degree relative. 
Excessive social anxiety because of paranoid fears: With this symptom criterion someone is anxious in social situations and over time that anxiety doesn't diminish. When we think of social anxiety, we think the more that an individual is around other people the better they're going to feel, like the main focus of exposure therapy. The social anxiety with schizotypal personality disorder doesn't go away with exposure, rather it actually gets worse.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1878,What is the Difference Between Borderline Personality Disorder and Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)?,2018-05-15,250386,7827,497,"This video describes the difference between borderline personality disorder and the concept of complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD). Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder in the DSM and complex posttraumatic stress disorder is not, but C-PTSD has been proposed to be a disorder in the ICD, which is another manual that's similar to the DSM. With complex PTSD, we see all of the same symptom criteria as we see with PTSD, except the trauma is conceptualized as complex, which is a trauma that occurred repeatedly and usually in someone's childhood as opposed to one single event. We also see a few other characteristics that are associated more so with C-PTSD than PTSD, including difficulty with self-perception, shame, guilt, a negative concept of self, a distorted image of the perpetrator, a preoccupation with revenge, interpersonal relationship difficulties, distrust, isolation, and a loss of meaning. Areas of overlap between C PTSD and borderline personality disorder include mood dysregulation, feelings of emptiness, loneliness, increased sense of guilt, increased difficulties with anger, and decreased self-worth. There's a lot of controversy over the relationship between C-PTSD and borderline personality disorder. One popular point of controversy includes the idea that C-PTSD should replace borderline personality disorder, so with this theory borderline personality disorder never should have been a mental health disorder and this whole time along it was really C-PTSD. In essence, the group that believes this is saying that C-PTSD better explains the symptoms than does borderline personality disorder. I can appreciate many of the elements of this argument, but there are some difficulties with it. The primary difficulty of this argument is that trauma is considered etiological for both borderline personality and C-PTSD. It's fairly easy to see how it could be etiological for C-PTSD, however, with borderline personality the story is quite a bit different. Many individuals who have borderline personality disorder do have a trauma in their history and a lot of times it is complex trauma, however, about 10 – 20% of individuals of with borderline personality disorder have no trauma history at all. Also, we know that with borderline personality or there's a substantial genetic component. Another theory as to the relationship between C-PTSD and borderline personality disorder is that C-PTSD is a subgroup of borderline personality disorder, and this subgroup is a better way to understand individuals with that particular grouping of symptoms. The last theory we see is that C-PTSD is distinct from borderline personality, and that we need both mental health disorders available. The main argument here is that the treatment is substantially different. The needs for individuals that have C-PTSD are greatly different or substantially different than the needs we see of individuals who have borderline personality disorder.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1879,What is the Highly Sensitive Person Construct? (Sensory Processing Sensitivity),2018-05-14,85396,4432,175,"This video describes the concept of a highly sensitive person. This construct was developed by Dr. Aron in the 1990s and there's a few terms that are all wrapped together and this gets a little bit confusing, which isn't uncommon for relatively new constructs in the world of personality theory. When we look at the highly sensitive person, it's an individual who has sensory processing sensitivity or they have the highly sensitive trait. This is not a mental health disorder, but rather a trait which would be largely considered based on genetics, so it would be heritable much of the time, although the environment could play a part in developing this trait. This construct is associated with a number of characteristics including an individual who's more reactive to stimuli, so they tend to get overstimulated by lights noise being in crowds. They tend to process a lot of sensory information, so they can detect subtle details and they're alert, but this can become overwhelming and they need to recharge. Sometimes we think of this construct as associated with needing more sleep. Some of these traits seem to be analogous to what we see in the five-factor model. This trait is associated with a higher level of conscientiousness, more creativity and imagination, and a decrease in the level of extraversion. The highly sensitive person tends to process emotions more deeply, have more empathy and have more emotional reactivity. Research indicates that about 15 to 20% of the population could be classified as highly sensitive. A few studies have indicated there might be three subtypes of the highly sensitive person: the aesthetic sensitivity type, the low sensory threshold type, and the ease of excitation type.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1880,What is Pica? (Eating Nonfood Substances),2018-05-12,12333,241,28,"This video describes pica, which is a mental health disorder that involves eating non-nutritive non-food substances. Usually, we think of pica as occurring mostly in childhood, but it does occur sometimes in adults. There are four criteria for a diagnosis of pica and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The first is persistently eating non-nutritive non-food substances for a period of at least one month. The second is that this behavior is not inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual. The third is that this is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice. The fourth is if this behavior co-occurs with another mental health disorder, like intellectual disability, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, or a medical condition, it's severe enough to warrant additional clinical attention. So if it's not severe enough to warrant that additional attention, it's not diagnosed. We see from the diagnostic criteria the substance has to be non-food, so we don't see a diagnosis of pica when an individual simply eats foods that aren't nutritional. There are a variety of possible substances that we've seen associated with pica including: chalk, hair, soap, metal, clay, ice, string, soil, talcum powder, paint, gum, and wool, as well as many other possible non-food substances. We don't know the cause of pica: and we don't know the prevalence of pica either. There are some risk factors for pica including developmental delay, neglect, a lack of supervision. There's also a possible link between iron deficiency and the development of pica. Usually, we see this in instances where the non-food substances is ice, however, it can be seen in other situations. In terms of treatment, there isn't any specific treatment protocol designed for pica. Usually, it's a version of cognitive behavioral therapy that's used and usually there's an emphasis on the behavior component.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1881,What is the Difference Between PTSD and Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)?,2018-05-10,64125,2317,122,"This video describes the differences between PTSD and C-PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder versus complex posttraumatic stress disorder). PTSD is an official mental health disorder in a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) so a diagnosis of PTSD can be given if someone meets the full criteria for that disorder. C-PTSD is more of a concept. It's not an official mental health disorder and there's a lot of overlap between PTSD and C-PTSD. With PTSD, there are a number of symptom criteria. First, we need a qualifying trauma for posttraumatic stress disorder, and that could be directly experiencing a trauma, witnessing a trauma, and there's some other circumstances that could occur. We see symptoms of intrusion, like distressing memories distressing dreams, flashbacks. There are symptoms of avoidance, like avoiding reminders of the trauma, trying to avoid thoughts and feelings associated with the trauma. There are negative mood symptoms, like a negative emotional state. There are symptoms of arousal, so this would be anger, hypervigilance, or a sleep disturbance, for example. Complex PTSD is somewhat similar, but the difference starts with the trauma. PTSD has a number of potential qualifying traumas. Complex PTSD the trauma is usually considered repetitive or continuous. The trauma associated with C-PTSD is often thought of as child physical abuse, child sexual abuse, or some other type of trauma that occurs repeatedly and usually during childhood. In general, the severity, frequency, and duration of symptoms would be considered greater with C- PTSD. Common C-PTSD symptoms include distorted perceptions about the perpetrator, difficulties with relationships, distrust, isolation, loss of meaning, and hopelessness.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1882,What is Synesthesia?,2018-05-08,4059,129,21,"This video describes synesthesia. Synesthesia is a condition, not a mental health disorder, in which the activation of one sense triggers the activation of another. A lot of times we think of this as just two senses being involved, but more than two senses can be involved, and also another version of the same sense can be involved this condition. Synesthesia is considered irrepressible and involuntary, so it's a response to stimuli that a person cannot turn off. There are many subtypes of synesthesia, but the most common would be where letters produce colors. The letter “B,” for example, could be viewed as orange. This is an example of one sense being activated in two different ways. The next most common type is where sounds are seen as colors, shapes, or textures. There are a number of possible combinations with this condition, more so than just the two common types. Any two senses or more than two senses, could activate at the same time or one activating in response to the other. 
There are a number of interesting facts and myths about synesthesia. We know that the associations that individuals make when they have this condition are amazingly consistent. We know that synesthesia tends to form early in life. It's not always one sense triggering another, rather there may be a bi-directional component for some individuals who have this condition. Synesthesia affects about 4% of the population it may have a genetic etiology. Another myth is that individuals with synesthesia have some sort of advantage, specifically, a memory advantage or an intellectual advantage. The evidence does not support this. There doesn't appear to be any differences in terms of intelligence or memory between people with this condition and those without it.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1883,What are the Risk Factors for Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)?,2018-05-07,21717,576,49,"This video describes the risk factors for intermittent explosive disorder (IED). Intermittent explosive disorder is a mental health disorder. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms. There are recurrent outbursts that represent a failure to control aggressive impulses. These outbursts can be verbal or physical and there can be destruction of property or assault involved. The behavior outbursts we see with intermittent explosive disorder are not premeditated and they're not done for some tangible objective. They're not done for trying to obtain money, fame, or some other goal. There's a spontaneous component and really a mysterious component to this disorder. We don't know what causes these outbursts to occur and we don't know what causes the disorder to occur. Some of the risk factors include genetics, head trauma, abnormalities in brain chemistry, brain infections, and seizures. Environmental factors that have been linked to the development of intermittent explosive disorder include exposure to violence, childhood trauma, being exposed to life-threatening situations, having an unstable family environment, and being exposed to alcohol or drugs. Certain personality disorder traits have been associated with intermittent explosive disorder, specifically narcissistic, antisocial, borderline, and histrionic personality disorder traits. The presence of ADHD has been linked to intermittent explosive disorder. Males are affected by intermittent explosive disorder at a higher rate than females. We also know that the behavioral outbursts that are part of intermittent explosive disorder are much more likely to occur during a period of stress.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1884,What is the Difference Between Schizotypal Personality Disorder and Schizophrenia?,2018-05-05,21281,640,33,"This video describes difference between schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is a Cluster A person a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's in the same cluster as schizoid and paranoid personality disorders. This is considered the odd, eccentric cluster. Schizotypal personality disorder is a pattern of social deficits. Schizophrenia is thought of as more severe than schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms including: ideas of reference, odd beliefs, or magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, odd thinking or speech, paranoid ideation, or being suspicious of other people, inappropriate or constricted affect behavior or appearance that could be described as odd, eccentric or peculiar, lack of close friends, and social anxiety. Schizophrenia is characterized by five potential symptoms including: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. Schizophrenia has persistent psychotic episodes that tend to be more prolonged, frequent, and intense than the brief psychosis we sometimes see schizotypal personality disorder. The “ideas of reference” in schizotypal personality disorder are not held with delusional conviction, which means somebody can usually be swayed from these beliefs. Otherwise, it would be a delusional reference, which is what we usually see with schizophrenia. Often, an individual with schizophrenia believes the delusions and cannot be swayed from those beliefs. Another symptom criteria with schizotypal personality disorder is odd thinking or speech, but this speech would not typically rise to the level of incoherence. With schizophrenia, there could be incoherent speech. 
Schizophrenia is sometimes conceptualized as having three phases: active phase (acute phase), prodromal phase, and residual phase. The active phase of Schizophrenia is characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms include avolition, which is a reduction in goal-directed behavior. The prodromal and residual phases are characterized by ideas of reference, unusual perceptions, vague speech, and negative symptoms. All the phases of Schizophrenia are associated with dysphoric mood, inappropriate affect, decreased interest in food and eating, sleep disturbance, and cognitive deficits. Hostility and aggression are sometimes associated with Schizophrenia, but the majority of individuals with Schizophrenia are not hostile or aggressive. Random assaults are not common. Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior. Anosognosia often occurs with Schizophrenia. Anosognosia is a lack of insight or awareness about having a disorder and is a strong predictor of poor treatment outcomes. Schizophrenia is typically treated with medication and psychotherapy.
Schizotypal Personality Disorder is in Cluster A in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This is the same cluster as Paranoid Personality Disorder and Schizoid Personality Disorder. Schizotypal Personality Disorder is characterized by ideas of reference, odd beliefs, unusual perceptions, odd thinking or speech (e.g. elaborate, metaphorical, vague), paranoid ideation, inappropriate and constricted affect, peculiar behavioral appearance, lacking close friends, and social anxiety. Schizotypal Personality Disorder affects males more often than females. The prevalence of Schizotypal Personality Disorder is about 4%. Schizotypal Personality Disorder is comorbid with Major Depressive Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1885,What is the difference between Paranoid Personality Disorder and Schizoid Personality Disorder?,2018-05-03,28582,702,31,"This video describes the difference between paranoid personality disorder and schizoid personality disorder. Both of these personality disorders are in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and are in Cluster A (odd, eccentric cluster). With paranoid personality disorder there are a number of potential symptoms including: suspecting others are harming deceiving or exploiting them, a preoccupation with doubts about the loyalty of friends and associates, reluctance to confide in individuals because they're afraid that information will be used against them, reading into benign remarks, tendency to hold grudges, and perceiving attacks on character or reputation even though there's no evidence to support that and are quick to have an angry reaction or to counter-attack, suspecting infidelity in a romantic relationship. Some of the associated features and consequences of paranoid personality disorder would be being socially isolated, having a need for control, being self-sufficient, being combative, litigious, critical of other people, having grandiose fantasies, appearing cold, lack empathy, and having few friends. With schizoid personality disorder, the symptoms include: no desire for close relationships, seeking out solitary activities, little or no interest in sexual activity, pleasure from few activities, lacking close friends, indifferent to praise or criticism, and appearing cold, detached, or having a flat effect. Some of the associated features and consequences we see with schizoid personality disorder would be that individual with this disorder oftentimes appears to be adrift in terms of goals, they don't appear to have a clear direction, they don't appear to have strong emotions to situations that would normally evoke strong emotions, and oftentimes even if they're provoked they won't have an angry reaction.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1886,What is Conduct Disorder?,2018-05-01,16530,414,12,"This video describes conduct disorder (CD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The symptom criteria for conduct disorder are divided into four categories. The first category is aggression to people and animals and there are seven symptom criteria in this category: threatens or intimidates others, often initiates physical fights, used a weapon to cause harm to another individual, demonstrated physical cruelty to people, demonstrated physical cruelty to animals, stolen while confronting a victim, and forced someone into sexual activity. The next category is destruction of property and this has two symptom criteria: set a fire with the intent of causing destruction, destroyed the property of others without involving fire. The next category is deceitfulness or theft and there are three symptom criteria here: broken into a house building or vehicle, often lies to obtain goods or to avoid obligations, stealing items without confrontation. The fourth category contains serious violations of rules and there are three symptom criteria: stays out all night, run away overnight at least twice or once if it's for lengthy period, and often truant from school. Three criteria have to be met in the last 12 months and at least one of those three has to also be met in the last six months. There also must be clinically significant impairment and if the individual is 18 years or older, that they do not meet the full criteria for antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder also has three subtypes: childhood onset type, adolescent onset type, and unspecified onset. There is also a “with limited pro-social emotions” specifier available.",May,Dr. Todd Grande
1887,What are the Types of Borderline Personality Disorder?,2018-04-30,33333,959,27,"This video describes potential subtypes of borderline personality disorder. The research on borderline personality disorder has inconsistent results in terms of the attempts identify subtypes. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), there are no subtypes reported for borderline personality disorder. In one study from 2013, three subtypes were identified: core borderline personality, extrovert/externalizing, and schizotypal/paranoid. There were five times as many people in the core borderline personality than in the extrovert/externalizing category and there were ten times as many in the extrovert/externalizing category as in the schizotypal/paranoid category. With core borderline personality, we see that this particular presentation is really what we think of when we think of borderline personality. This particular presentation was absent a lot of other personality disorder dimensions and individuals in this group had lower levels of childhood trauma, which was a bit of a surprising finding. It's important to keep in mind though that with these participants, trauma was high in general, so there were only lower levels of trauma in this first potential subtype relative to the other subtypes. With the extrovert/externalizing subtype, men were over-represented. There were more men in this category proportionally than we saw in the other categories. There was a higher quality of life. Also, there were features from other personality disorders including narcissistic, antisocial, and histrionic. This group had a higher level of childhood trauma relative to the other two groups. The last potential subtype was schizotypal/paranoid. There were also personality disorder features, and as is indicated by the name, they were schizotypal and paranoid personality disorder features. The participants in this category also had higher levels of social isolation, higher levels of attachment anxiety, lower levels of self-confidence, and lower levels of assertiveness.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1888,Does Television Viewing Increase the Risk of Antisocial Personality Disorder?,2018-04-28,3816,117,6,"This video describes the relationship between television watching and antisocial personality disorder. To answer this question, I'm going to use an article that was published in 2013 written by Robertson and colleagues. This particular study had a large sample size from New Zealand (almost a thousand participants) and it was a longitudinal study (26 years). The findings of this research study indicated that increased television watching in childhood and adolescence was associated with an increased likelihood of having antisocial behaviors and personality traits in adulthood. We could think of these antisocial behaviors and personality traits as antisocial outcomes. In this study they were measured through criminal convictions, a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder and personality traits associated with antisocial behavior. The study also found that increased television watching was associated with a decrease in positive emotionality. Several different negative consequences were linked with television watching. The effect of television watching stayed in place even after the researchers accounted for other variables that may explain the antisocial behavior including IQ, socioeconomic status, early antisocial behavior, and a construct called parental control. The content of the television programs was not observed as part of the study. It's assumed that violent content in the television programming caused this association to occur, but that may not necessarily be true. Some of the possible explanations for these findings include observational learning, emotional desensitization, and the normalization of aggressive behavior. Another theory is because this is just a correlation between two variables, it could be that antisocial behavior or a predisposition for antisocial behavior causes increased television watching. It seems reasonable to be concerned about this link between increased levels of television watching and an increased likelihood of demonstrating antisocial behavior. The study discusses a recommendation that children shouldn't watch more than 1 to 2 hours of television programming a day. One particularly concerning finding related to this in the study is that each additional hour of television viewing that you add per day increases the risk of a criminal conviction by 30%. When considering the value of television watching it makes sense to weigh the possible consequences.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1889,What is the Difference Between Narcissistic and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorders?,2018-04-26,39079,1189,49,"This video describes the difference between narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). 
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) is a Cluster C personality disorder, which is the anxious, fearful cluster. The DSM symptom criteria include: preoccupation with details, order, schedules, and lists, perfectionism, excessive devotion to productivity, over-conscientiousness, difficulty in discarding objects that are worthless or are at the end of their useful life, reluctance to delegate tasks, a miserly spending style, and rigidity. OCPD is one of the more prevalent personality disorders. It tends to affect males to females at a rate of about two to one.
Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with unlimited success, feeling too special to be understood by regular people, needing excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, being interpersonally exploitative, having a lack of empathy, being envious and others and believe others are envious of them, and being arrogant. Oftentimes an individual with Narcissistic Personality Disorder wants to be recognized as superior, believes they are so complex and amazing that they can only be understood by special people, has low self-esteem, devalues the contributions of others, and is condescending. Criticism is not well received by most people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. 
The reason these two disorders are confused with one another has a lot to do with perception. Some of the same characteristics are in both personality disorders, but for different reasons. Also, the expression of the characteristic is a little bit different between the two disorders. 
The first reason has to do with the perception of being supercilious. With narcissistic personality disorder, this is when somebody is trying to appear superior, however, with OCPD this is really just a byproduct of the behavior. Individuals with OCPD have a real commitment to perfectionism and sometimes this is interpreted as being supercilious. The next reason is lack of empathy with both disorders. There is a lack of empathy with both disorders, but for different reasons. With NPD we believe that an individual with this disorder usually does have the ability to empathize, but they don't use that ability. With OCPD, the same thing is true, but the way we usually think about OCPD is that somebody has the ability to empathize but they are not very good at it. Oftentimes with OCPD, we see that individuals with this disorder have difficulty expressing themselves with body language and sometimes this can be interpreted as not having empathy. Another reason these two disorders are confused is because we see a lack of generosity in both of these disorders. With NPD that lack of generosity is with other people. Usually somebody with narcissistic personality disorder will indulge themselves, but not so with other people. With OCPD, it's more of a global effect. Somebody with OCPD would not spend money on others, but also they would not spend money on themselves. Another reason we see for the confusion is the condescending attitude that we sometimes see with NPD and OCPD. This condescending attitude can have the same feel with both of these disorders, but with NPD it's usually more globalized. With OCPD, the behavior is specific to certain situations, such as with certain types of personalities. In most cases an individual with OCPD will have more of a condescending attitude with people that they determine as immature, irresponsible, or impulsive. The next reason for the confusion with these two disorders is the commitment to perfectionism. With NPD, we see this expressed as an individual who really believes they have achieved perfection. People with OCPD are often quite self-critical. They do not believe they have achieved perfectionism. The last reason for the confusion between these two disorders is the level of productivity we see in the work environment. The reason for the work productivity or the perception of being productive at work is different for both of these disorders. With NPD, we usually think of it as an abundance of confidence, however, with OCPD, it's more of the dedication to perfectionism, liking orderliness, being meticulous, being detail oriented, and liking organization.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1890,What is Dependent Personality Disorder?,2018-04-24,21827,704,35,"This video describes dependent personality disorder. Dependent personality disorder is a cluster C personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It's in the same cluster as avoidant personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality. Cluster C is considered the anxious and fearful cluster. The symptom criteria for dependent person include number of potential symptoms including having difficulty making everyday decisions without excessive advice and reassurance from others, needing others to assume responsibilities for most areas of one's life, difficulty expressing disagreement, going to excessive lengths to obtain support, feeling helpless when one is alone, seeking relationships for support right after another supportive relationship ends, and a preoccupation with fears of being left to take care of oneself. There's a theme with dependent personality disorder that somebody is concerned about being abandoned and having to take care of themselves and has trouble making decisions. Other characteristics and associated features with dependent personality disorder include being submissive and passive, having a low amount of anger even in situations where some anger would be justified, tolerating abuse, having a pessimistic attitude, and appearing clingy. With dependent personality disorder, men are more at risk to be perpetrators of domestic violence and men and women with dependent personality disorder are at a greater risk to be perpetrators of child abuse. There is also at a greater risk to commit self-harm.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1891,Self-Disclosure as a Technique in Counseling,2018-04-23,15074,311,16,"This video describes the concept of “self-disclosure in mental health counseling. Self disclosure on the part of the counselor is a controversial issue. We know a little bit about self disclosure from the research, but it doesn't always help us resolve the controversy. Self disclosure tends to vary a lot by modality. If we look at the psychodynamic modality, for instance, self disclosure is typically frowned upon in this modality. With modality like cognitive therapy, self disclosure is often encouraged. Self disclosure can also vary by timing. If a client is being treated for symptoms and that treatment lasts six months, toward the end of that six-month period we would expect to see more self disclosure than we would early on, if any self disclosure takes place. There's also variance based on the symptoms with which a client presents. Research shows us that when clients are more symptomatic, self-disclosure by the counselor tends to be lower. The research is mixed on whether self-disclosure is effective in counseling. We know there are some pros and cons to self disclosure. On the pro side, it builds rapport and trust. On the con side we often hear that it causes role confusion, it can create an expectation that the client is supposed to share information, it could meet the need of the clinician more than the client, and it could place a burden on the client. So there are a number of pitfalls when considering the use of self disclosure. If it's difficult to figure out whether a self disclosure is appropriate seek supervision. Supervision is a process that's helpful for counselors for a lot of different areas, but specifically it does help with determining these type of boundary issues. This controversy around self disclosure or this technique of self disclosure is really a boundary issue. Supervision is almost always a good idea when somebody's in doubt about how they're practicing counseling.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1892,What are the Emotional and Cognitive Characteristics of Antisocial Personality Disorder?,2018-04-22,28228,905,22,"This video describes the emotional and cognitive characteristics of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Antisocial personality disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by a number of potential symptoms including lack of remorse, low empathy, a disregard for safety, mistreatment of individuals, repeatedly engaging activities that could be grounds for arrest, lying, fighting, and a lot of other symptoms that have an impact on society and on the individual. We usually think of this impact as negative. Antisocial personality disorder has been associated with a lower level of agreeableness and conscientiousness on the five-factor model, but it's not clear how it relates to openness to experience, extraversion, or neuroticism. It may have associations with certain facets on those traits, but it doesn't appear to have a strong association at the trait level for those traits. In terms of the emotional processing, antisocial personality disorder has been associated with a lower level of control over emotions and a lower level of insight into emotions. Also, we see a decreased ability to experience what are referred to as “complex emotions,” specifically guilt, trust, respect, and closeness. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder have a greater risk of experiencing difficulty recalling emotional information and they tend to have a fairly good memory when it comes to negative affect, but a poor memory for positive emotions.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1893,Driving Styles and Personality Traits,2018-04-20,3635,113,13,"This video describes the relationship between driving styles and personality traits. Overall, personality traits are related to driving style. There is no set definition of driving styles, but I'm going to use one definition that's been put for it that has four different types: careful driving style, reckless driving style, anxious driving style, and hostile angry driving style. For personality traits I like to use the five-factor model, and it's remembered by the acronym OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. When comparing the the driving styles to the five-factor model the personality traits we see a number of associations. With the careful driving style, we typically see a high level of agreeableness, a high level of conscientiousness, and a high level of openness to experience. With the reckless driving style, we see high extraversion, low agreeableness, and low conscientiousness. With the anxious driving style, we see a higher level of neuroticism. With the angry driving style we also see a high level of neuroticism, but also a high level of extraversion, a low level of agreeableness, and a lower level of conscientiousness.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1894,What is the difference between Paranoid Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder?,2018-04-19,37756,1088,46,"This video describes the difference between Paranoid Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder. 
Avoidant personality disorder is a cluster C personality disorder (anxious fearful cluster). In that same cluster there is dependent personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder, like any personality disorder, is usually thought of as long lasting and pervasive. If we look at the symptom criteria for avoidant personality disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) we see a number of potential symptoms. The first is that an individual avoids an occupation because of a risk of rejection. The second symptom criterion is the individual does not want to get in relationships unless there's a certainty that they'll be liked. The third symptom criterion is individual has difficulty forming intimate relationships. This symptom really refers to the fact that they have difficulty oftentimes with that. It's not about a desire for intimate relationships, but rather the actual ability to form them. The next symptom criterion is a preoccupation with being criticized. Next is difficulty forming new relationships. An individual could have an inhibition when trying to form a new relationship. The next criterion is a feeling of being inept or inferior. The last symptom cried is the individual does not take risks because of fear of embarrassment. If we look at avoidant personality disorder we see that somebody would generally isolates because of a fear of criticism, rejection, and possibly because of embarrassment. When we think of this personality disorder, we think there's excessive monitoring of an individual's internal reactions. An individual with this disorder is often thinking about how other people are viewing them and thinking about how they could be being criticized, embarrassed, or rejected. This excessive monitoring leads to difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships.
Paranoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of suspiciousness and distrust of others. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder will often question the loyalty of others, believe others are trying to harm them, and are reluctant to confide in people. They sometimes see demeaning aspects in benign comments and behaviors. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder tend hold grudges and have difficultly forgiving perceived wrongs. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder who are married tend to question the fidelity of their partners. Paranoid Personality Disorder are in Cluster A of the personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) along with Schizoid Personality Disorder and Schizotypal Personality Disorder. Brief psychosis can occur with Paranoid Personality Disorder, which can make diagnosing this disorder more difficult due to association of psychosis with Schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder. Disorders that are comorbid with Paranoid Personality Disorder include Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Substance Use Disorder, Agoraphobia, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Schizotypal Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. The prevalence of Paranoid Personality Disorder in the population is about 2% - 4%.

Areas of overlap between these two disorders includes: having a reluctance to confide in people, having difficulty starting new relationships, having difficulty with intimate relationships, being perceived as cold, being perceived as lacking empathy, being socially isolated, and interpersonal aloofness.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1895,What is Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?,2018-04-17,52821,1321,88,"This video describes Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), OCPD is a Cluster C personality disorder, which is the anxious, fearful cluster. The other two personality disorders in Cluster C are Avoidant Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder. OCPD is often confused with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There is high comorbidity between these two disorders. If somebody has obsessive compulsive disorder, there is a 25% chance they would also qualify for a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive personality disorder. There are a number of key differences to differentiate them. One difference that stands out the most is that OCPD doesn't have obsessions or compulsions. We also see a lack of insight with OCPD more often than we do with OCD. Also, perfectionism is a key characteristic we see an OCPD that we don't always see in OCD. 
The DSM symptom criteria include: preoccupation with details, order, schedules, and lists, perfectionism, excessive devotion to productivity, over-conscientiousness, difficulty in discarding objects that are worthless or are at the end of their useful life, reluctance to delegate tasks, a miserly spending style, and rigidity. OCPD is one of the more prevalent personality disorders. It tends to affect males to females at a rate of about two to one.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1896,What Causes Antisocial Personality Disorder? (Etiology & Risk Factors),2018-04-16,41918,1312,35,"This video describes potential causes and risk factors for antisocial personality disorder. Whenever we talk about causation and mental health disorders, we think of the term “etiology.” When something is etiological to a disorder, it is causal. Often with mental health disorders, we really don't know what causes the disorder, rather we see certain associations. Certain factors seem to be consistently associated with the development of disorders. Antisocial personality disorder is a disorder characterized by a number of potential symptoms including: repeated behaviors that could be grounds for arrest, lying, fighting, a disregard for safety, inconsistent work behaviors, maltreatment of other individuals, poor social conformity, lack of remorse, and impulsivity. In terms of the ideological factors for antisocial personality disorder, we believe that genetics explain about 50% of the variance, which leaves 50% of the variance to the environment. The way that genetics and the environment interact is complex, so we don't really have precision with this, but still we know that a large portion is probably explained by the environment. There are a number of factors here that have been identified as being associated with the development of antisocial personality disorder including: maltreatment as a child (e.g. neglect, abuse), teasing, an overprotective mother (although this factor is not clear), witnessing intimate partner violence, and television viewing.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1897,"What is Purely Obsessional (""Pure O"") Obsessive Compulsive Disorder? (Primarily Cognitive OCD)",2018-04-15,24048,783,44,"This video describes the concept of purely obsessional OCD (also referred to as “Pure O,” primarily cognitive OCD, OCD with covert compulsions, and primarily obsessional OCD). All these terms are referring to the same construct. It's not a mental health disorder, but rather a particular presentation we sometimes see with obsessive-compulsive disorder. With obsessive-compulsive disorder, we usually think of this disorder as having both obsessions and compulsions. In rare instances it can have only obsessions or only compulsions. The term Pure O is not referring to a presentation of OCD that only has obsessions, but rather a presentation of OCD that has obsessions and covert compulsions. Obsessions are thoughts images and impulses that are disturbing intrusive and unwanted. Compulsions are behaviors that occur to neutralize those obsessions. What we see with Pure O are obsessions and covert compulsions. With Pure O the obsessions have a different type of characteristic than with regular OCD. The obsessions are oftentimes violent, sexual, offensive, or evil types of thoughts, images and impulses. 
The term Pure O is misleading. I prefer the term “primarily cognitive OCD.” The reason the term Pure O is misleading is because there is a type of OCD that only has obsessions, but that's not to what Pure O is referring. Someone could hear the term Pure O and not only fail to understand what it's about, but believe it's about something entirely different.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1898,What is Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)?,2018-04-13,43709,1202,29,"This video describes dialectical behavior therapy. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a modality that was created by Marsha Linehan in the 1980s and it was specifically designed to treat individuals with borderline personality disorder. Even more specifically it treats the characteristic of suicidal tendencies that sometimes observed in borderline personality disorder. DBT is a particularly complex modality. It has a number of different components that were borrowed from a number of other theories and modalities. It is generally thought of as a program only modality, although there are versions of it that can be delivered by an individual clinician. From a client's point of view DBT has three main activities: individual therapy (usually about two hours a week), group counseling (an hour and a half to two and a half hours a week) and telephone coaching (available 24/7). From the therapist point of view, you have those three components and a therapist consultation component. There are five functions to DBT. The first is enhancing capabilities and this is really skills training. This skills training has four modules known as the “four modules of DBT.” This includes mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. The second function is generalizing capabilities. The third function is improving motivation and reducing dysfunctional behavior. The fourth function is enhancing and maintaining therapist capabilities and motivation, and this is met through support training and encouragement to the therapist.
Dialectical behavior therapy is based on three theories, biosocial theory, dialectical philosophy, and behavior therapy. The biosocial theory has to do with emotional vulnerability, which is related to the invalidating experiences that we believe may lead to or at least may contribute to the development of borderline personality disorder. Dialectical philosophy is about the tension between acceptance and the desire to change. This tension is experienced by the client and by the therapist. Behavior therapy has lot of the techniques from other behavioral modalities including cognitive restructuring, components of exposure therapy, and adaptive responding.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1899,What is Adjustment Disorder?,2018-04-12,26039,519,31,"This video describes adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorder is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The first criterion we see with adjustment disorder is that behavioral or emotional symptoms occur in response to an identifiable stressor. The onset of these disturbances or this disturbance must occur within three months of that identified stressor. The disturbance must cause clinically significant symptoms (second criterion), which is indicated by one or both of these following criteria: marked distress that's out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor taking into account cultural factors and external context and/or significant impairment. The third criterion is the disturbance does not meet the full criteria of another mental health disorder and it's not simply an exacerbation of an existing mental health disorder. The fourth criteria is that the presentation is not normal bereavement. The fifth criterion indicates that if the stressor terminates that we shouldn't see symptoms lasting more than six months. Adjustment disorder has six specifiers: depressed mood, anxiety, mixed anxiety and depressed mood, disturbance of conduct, mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, and unspecified. so six specifiers for adjustment disorder and the DSM indicates some situations where adjustment disorder may including the termination of a romantic relationship, marital problems, living in a crime-ridden neighborhood, going to school, getting married, retiring, and failing to meet occupational goals.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1900,Six Myths about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2018-04-10,11527,436,7,"This video covers six myths of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a mental health disorder characterized by obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (behaviors designed to reduce the obsessions). 
Myth number one is that OCD is easy to spot. OCD has obsessions and compulsions, and a lot of the times individuals with OCD realize how unusual the compulsive behaviors look to outside observers. They may be embarrassed, so they make an effort to hide the compulsive behaviors. OCD is not always easy to spot.
Myth number two is that people with OCD don't realize the obsessions are irrational. With this myth we really have to understand the specifiers of OCD. We could think of OCD as having three specifiers related to this: good or fair insight, poor insight, and absent insight or delusional beliefs. Many people fall into the category where they have good or fair insight so they would realize the obsessions are irrational. 
Myth number three is that all compulsions are behaviors. Not all compulsions are behaviors. Some compulsions are thoughts. 
Myth number four is that OCD is really just a vigorous desire to be neat. There are a number of possible obsessions with OCD, including some that drive compulsions to be neat, however, OCD is far more complex than that one observable potential symptom. 
Myth number five is that OCD is really just a personality type. OCD doesn't have anything to do with a personality type, although it is often comorbid with OCPD.
Myth number six is that OCD is the same thing as obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). These two diagnoses are easily confused because the names are so similar and some of the behaviors we see associated with these two disorders are similar as well. With obsessive compulsive personality disorder, we see a preoccupation with rules, details, and schedules. We also see perfectionism, inflexibility, and being rigid or stubborn.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1901,What is Borderline Rage? (Borderline Personality Disorder Anger),2018-04-09,190195,6266,474,"This video describes the concept of “borderline rage,” which refers to the anger that is oftentimes seen with borderline personality disorder. Specifically, one of the criterion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) indicates inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger. I believe a lot of times when we see this term “borderline rage” it is referring to that even though when we think of rage, we think of a more primitive type of anger. I think one of the reasons is that with borderline personality disorder, the anger does appear to be more intense and more primal than we would see with somebody without borderline personality disorder. Anger in borderline personality just one symptom, however, it's the symptom that tends to get noticed first or at least one of the symptoms that tends to get noticed early on. That's because of the outward acting component of anger. Anger expressed in borderline personality is not simple. We see constant anger, which is when somebody appears to be angry all the time. There is automatic anger, which is anger that comes about without any stimuli or at least without any stimuli that would normally provoke anger. We can also see triggered anger. That is anger that does have an apparent cause. Oftentimes with borderline personality disorder, we believe the anger has higher intensity, a lower threshold to activate, and an extended duration. The anger associated with borderline personality disorder is often pervasive, internalized (“quiet borderline”) and externalized, cyclic associated with a desire for revenge, and there is a lack of insight as to the origin.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1902,Seven Myths about Major Depressive Disorder,2018-04-08,22625,1004,38,"This video describes seven myths of depression (Major Depressive Disorder).
Myth number one is that depression is expected, everyone gets it from time to time, and it's not a real disorder. One reason this myth was started and continues is because of the normal emotion or feeling of sadness. The terms depression and sadness become confused. Sadness is normal and experienced by everyone at some time, however, depression is not just a strong feeling of sadness.  
Myth number two is that depression is always triggered by stress. Major depressive episodes that occur in major depressive disorder can be triggered by stress but they're not always triggered by stress. 
Myth number three is that depression isn't dangerous or serious. Depression is quite serious. Even if you take away the risk of suicide and self-harm, depression still has a lot of consequences. It affects relationships, career, self-esteem, and how productive somebody can be. 
Myth number four is that you can't be depressed and anxious at the same time. Not only can somebody be depressed and anxious at the same time, it's actually remarkably common. 
Myth number five is that people with depression simply need to snap out of it. Someone can't just snap out of a major depressive episode or from depressive feelings. It simply has nothing to do with this disorder. 
Myth number six is that talking about depression will make the symptoms worse. We know that mental health counseling mental health talk therapy tends to be quite effective for major depressive disorder, so talking about it in that context is usually helpful. 
Myth number seven is that depression will go away by itself. Even though some depressive episodes may end without treatment, mental health treatment tends to reduce the duration of major depressive episodes. Treatment is the most effective way to reduce the symptoms of depression, not “toughing it out” or “waiting it out.”",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1903,What is Depersonalization Derealization Disorder?,2018-04-07,71476,2113,131,"This video describes depersonalization-derealization disorder. With depersonalization-derealization disorder, we see criteria that has a dissociative property as well as some other criteria. The classification for depersonalization-derealization disorder is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). We see with the symptom criteria that somebody would have a depersonalization experience or a derealization experience or both. With depersonalization, this would be experiencing detachment, unreality, or feeling like you're an outside observer to your own body, thoughts, actions, and feelings. This would be a distorted sense of self, perceptual distortions, or emotional or physical numbing. Derealization is similar but it's an experience of detachment or unreality related to surroundings. This would be experiencing other people or objects in a dreamlike, foggy, or visually-distorted or unreal way. There are other criteria for this disorder including that reality testing is intact during the experiences. The first thing we might think of we hear about depersonalization and derealization is psychosis, but it's not the same thing as psychosis. An individual with depersonalization and derealization can separate reality from fantasy throughout the entire experience. With psychosis, of course, that would not be the case. Other criteria include there is clinically significant distress and this would be in areas of social occupational or other functioning, and the experiences are not attributable to substances a medical condition or better explained by another mental health disorder like schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for example. The dissociative experiences that we see in depersonalization-derealization disorder can last hours, days, weeks, months, and sometimes even years, so it's highly variable in terms of how long the symptoms can be present. Some common descriptions we hear with this disorder on the depersonalization side would be an out-of-body experience, feeling robotic, lacking control over movement or thought or feeling, and also knowing that feelings should be present but being unable to feel. With derealization some of the common descriptions are looking at the environment and it feels artificial, lifeless, or colorless. Also, visual distortions and auditory distortions are common with derealization, in particular, visual distortions. These experiences of depersonalization and derealization are actually quite common. Most people will experience this type of dissociative event at some point in their life but only about 2% of individuals will meet the full criteria for this disorder. Depersonalization-derealization disorder affects males and females at the same rate and typically has an early onset. We think of this disorder as having an early onset compared to a number of other disorders. The mean age onset is 16 and an onset of depersonalization-derealization disorder after the age of 20 would only occur about 20% of the time, and after age 25 only about 5% at a time. There are a number of mental health disorders that co-occur with depersonalization-derealization disorder. We see major depressive disorder and all of the anxiety disorders are comorbid with depersonalization-derealization disorder. Avoidant personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder are fairly common comorbid mental health disorders with depersonalization-derealization disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is actually not highly comorbid with this disorder.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1904,What is Maladaptive Daydreaming?,2018-04-05,79825,3181,286,"This video describes maladaptive daydreaming. The term “maladaptive daydreaming” was originally coined by a professor named Eli Somer in a 2002 paper. Daydreaming is relatively common - over 95% of people daydream on a daily basis - but not all daydreaming is maladaptive. The common type of daydreaming deals with reviewing interactions and planning. Maladaptive daydreaming is quite different. We see certain characteristics that have been associated with that term that deviate quite a bit from what we think of as normal daydreaming. For example, vivid daydreams, difficulty sleeping, a strong desire to daydream, an extended duration of the daydream, and long daydreams. Sometimes during these maladaptive daydreams there are various facial expressions, talking, and repetitive movement. This concept has been described as addictive and eliciting strong emotions. Often maladaptive daydreams are described as rewarding, which is consistent with the addictive property that's been observed. Maladaptive daydreams have been associated with dissociation, which is a symptom we oftentimes see when people have experienced early childhood trauma. However, studies have found that there doesn't seem to be a particularly strong link between trauma and maladaptive daydreaming. Maladaptive daydreaming is not a mental health disorder, however, there has been research showing it may be comorbid with several mental health disorders including ADHD, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1905,Eight Myths about Panic Attacks,2018-04-04,27182,818,51,"This video describes eight myths regarding panic attacks. A panic attack is a period of intense fear anxiety and worry that also has physical symptoms associated with it like increased heart rate, trembling, dizziness, and sweating. 
Myth number one is if you have panic attacks you have panic disorder. Panic attacks are a symptom of a number of mental health disorders and in and of themselves don't represent a mental health disorder. There is no panic attack disorder, rather panic disorder is one of the disorders that has panic attacks associated with it. 
Myth number two is that panic attacks lead to a psychotic disorder. There's a fear with panic attacks that they must be indicative of something more serious and it doesn't help that during panic attacks some people experience depersonalization and derealization. We even hear presentations where there are sometimes auditory and visual hallucinations. A disorder characterized by psychosis is much different than a lot of disorders that have panic attacks as a feature. Panic attacks don't lead to any type of psychotic disorder, but sometimes panic attack symptoms can occur at the same time as psychosis caused by another mental health disorder. 
Myth number three is that you can avoid panic attacks by avoiding triggers. This is a bit of a tricky myth because with social anxiety disorder for example, one can avoid some panic attacks by avoiding triggers, but with panic disorder the panic attacks are unexpected and there is no real trigger. The trigger would be worrying about another panic attack. This myth is not as clear-cut, though we usually think of as a bad idea to make a concerted effort to avoid triggers in the long run. Avoiding triggers often restricts someone's life and blocks off more and more activities. 
Myth number four is that panic attacks can cause somebody to lose control. Generally, panic attacks don't cause somebody to be aggressive or violent or lose control in any way.
Myth number five is that panic attacks can cause fainting or passing out. Only rarely is this the case. Generally, panic attacks really work in the other direction. Somebody would be more ramped up be ready for more activity rather than being set up to faint or pass out. 
Myth number six is that panic attacks can last for hours. Normally, we see panic attacks reach their peak in about five to ten minutes and then they start subsiding. The effects of panic attacks can certainly be felt for hours. Usually somebody will feel anxious, drained, and physically tired after a panic attack, but the actual period of intense fear and the physical symptoms usually peaks about five ten minutes and then starts to improve over the next few minutes. 
Myth number seven is that breathing techniques don't help. Breathing has an interesting relationship with panic attacks. A lot of times we hear the advice with panic attacks that somebody should take deep breaths. This is actually usually a bad idea. When we think of panic attacks one of the concerns is hyperventilation, but hyperventilation doesn't really have anything to do with getting too little oxygen, rather it has to do with having too little carbon dioxide. Deep breathing will actually lower the amount of carbon dioxide and could make a panic attack a bit worse. That doesn't mean that breathing techniques are a bad idea or don't help. The kind of breathing that helps normally during a panic attack is normal breathing. The kind that helps is breathing slowly at a measured pace. Breathing techniques are actually a major part of coping with panic attacks. 
Myth number eight is that panic attacks can't be treated. Panic attacks are potentially symptoms of mental health disorders. Treatment effectiveness of panic attacks really depends on what mental health disorders, if any, are operating and what symptoms of those mental health disorders are being addressed in treatment. Even though panic attacks are extremely distressing, they're not always the priority for a client receiving treatment with a mental health disorder that could lead to panic attacks. Panic attacks can be treated, but in terms of how effective treatment is, it really depends on the priorities. Also, each individual is different and responds differently to treatment. It is a myth that panic attacks can't be treated, but it's important to recognize there are a lot of variables that influence the effectiveness of that treatment.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1906,What is the difference between Avoidant Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder?,2018-04-03,40282,1355,62,"This video describes the difference between Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD) and Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD). Both Avoidant Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder are Cluster C personality disorders (anxious fearful cluster). In that same cluster there is dependent personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder, like any personality disorder, is usually thought of as long lasting and pervasive. If we look at the symptom criteria for avoidant personality disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) we see a number of potential symptoms.

If we look at avoidant personality disorder we see that somebody would generally isolates because of a fear of criticism, rejection, and possibly because of embarrassment. When we think of this personality disorder, we think there's excessive monitoring of an individual's internal reactions. An individual with this disorder is often thinking about how other people are viewing them and thinking about how they could be being criticized, embarrassed, or rejected. This excessive monitoring leads to difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships.
With dependent personality disorder, we see different symptom criteria such as trouble making decisions without reassurance from other people, needing others to assume responsibilities, difficulty expressing disagreement with other people, difficulty initiating projects because of low self-esteem, going to excessive lengths to obtain support from other people, feeling helpless when one is alone, skipping from one dependent relationship to another, and a preoccupation with fears of having to take care of oneself. The theme with dependent personality disorder is this fear of not having support and this fear of having to take care of the items of daily life by oneself. 
With both avoidant and dependent personality disorders we see this feeling of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance. In terms of what differentiates the two, with avoidant personality disorder there's a real focus on rejection and embarrassment and with dependent personality disorder it's more about that loss of support. We tend to see submissive behavior with dependent personality disorder more often than we would see with avoidant personality disorder.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1907,Grandiose vs. Vulnerable Narcissism,2018-04-02,50634,1344,56,"This video describes the concepts of grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism. When we think about the term narcissism and mental health, we sometimes think of the personality disorder named narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Grandiose and vulnerable types of narcissism are not part of the classification system in the DSM, so with narcissistic personality disorder we don't have a grandiose type or vulnerable type. These are just two ways to think of narcissism, but they're not directly related to the diagnosis of NPD. With grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, both of these types of narcissism would have anger and tendency to be uncooperative, a manipulation component, and being cold, antagonistic, and hostile.
In the five-factor model, we see differences between vulnerable and grandiose narcissism. Both of these types are associated with low agreeableness. Where we see differences will be the other personality traits. Grandiose narcissism is characterized by low agreeableness, but high extraversion and low neuroticism. Vulnerable narcissism has low agreeableness, low extraversion, and high neuroticism.",Apr,Dr. Todd Grande
1908,Psychotic Depression vs  Nonpsychotic Depression,2018-03-31,36923,846,25,"This video describes the difference between psychotic depression and nonpsychotic depression. If we look at the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), there is a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Within major depressive disorder, there are severity specifiers. One of those specifiers is MDD with psychotic features. This is referred to as psychotic depression and all the other specifiers of MDD would be nonpsychotic depression.
About 15% of individuals diagnosed with MDD would qualify as having psychotic depression. In the inpatient population, about 25% of individuals with MDD would have psychotic depression. With psychotic depression there is an elevated risk of the disorder converting into bipolar disorder, particularly if there's an early onset of psychotic depression. Also, relatives of individuals who have psychotic depression have a higher prevalence of bipolar disorder. An individual who has parents with bipolar disorder has an increased risk for psychotic depression, but not for nonpsychotic depression. With psychotic depression, there is an increased depression score overall when compared to nonpsychotic depression.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1909,Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Emotional Processing,2018-03-29,20777,691,23,"This video describes the emotional processing abilities often observed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Much of the information regarding emotional processing and NPD is consistent with the symptom criteria we see for NPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The first area with the emotional processing of NPD is a condition known as alexithymia. This is a condition we sometimes see with narcissistic personality disorder and other mental health disorders. Alexithymia is a condition where an individual has difficulty identifying their own feelings and difficulty differentiating their feelings from bodily sensations. Also, individuals with alexithymia have difficulty identifying feelings in other people. The next item related to emotional processing with NPD is aggression. 
A lack of empathy is often associated with NPD. It's actually one of the symptom criteria in the DSM, but interestingly there is a difference when we look at empathy between cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. Research indicates that individuals with NPD generally have cognitive empathy that's within the normal range. It’s the same as individuals that do not have NPD. The emotional empathy, however, appears to be compromised. An individual NPD can often feel but they don't act. They can, in many cases, understand what somebody's feeling, but there's no movement to act on that feeling, so this is where we see the lack of empathy. It is really in the observable behavior rather than the cognitive process. Another interesting item related to emotional processing an NPD is a number of individuals with NPD have fragile self-esteem. When we look at the symptom criteria this would not be obvious. Self-esteem can be boosted externally, for example, by being promoted work, doing well at work, or receiving praise from other people. It can also be moved downward externally. The last item covered here with NPD related to emotional processing is a term we see in the literature referred to as an “expectation of super empathetic understanding.” This is a condition that we see with many disorders, not just with NPD. This is when an individual with NPD would believe that other people automatically know how they feel, what they're thinking, and what they expect. This leads to what are referred to as “silent demands.” An individual with MPD may expect people to know what they're thinking and put demands on them. When those demands are not met, this could lead to a number of negative reactions including aggression or a decrease in self-esteem.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1910,What Causes Aggressive Driving?,2018-03-27,7513,157,11,"This video describes the causes of aggressive driving. When we think of aggressive driving there are a number of definitions out there. I'm going to use the definition that aggressive driving is driving behavior intended to cause harm. This can be physical harm or psychological harm, but either way there's intentionality with this type of definition of aggressive driving. Different behaviors we may observe with aggressive driving would be excessively using the horn, weaving in and out of traffic, tailgating, yelling, making crude gestures. and in extreme cases colliding into another vehicle. There is kind of gray area here with this definition when it comes to someone yelling inside their car when there's no expectation that they could be heard or seen by another driver. It's also important to recognize there's the difference between aggressive driving and bad driving. All aggressive driving is bad driving, but not all bad driving is aggressive driving. 
There are a number of reasons for aggressive driving, but one of the major contributors that we believe would be anonymity. This is someone believes they are not going to get caught because their identity is unknown to other motorists. Anonymity has been shown, not just with driving but in general, to be associated with more risk-taking behavior and increased probability of seeing criminal behavior. Other factors come into play other than anonymity, including stressors. Driving can be very stressful and certainly that can be a trigger for aggressive behavior. It's also important to differentiate aggressive driving from high sensation-seeking. Sometimes this is referred to as reckless driving or the reckless driving style. Individuals with this style aren't necessarily intending to cause harm. They use driving as a way to experience excitement, which is bad driving, but it's not necessarily aggressive driving.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1911,"What is the Difference Between Acute, Chronic, and Complex Trauma?",2018-03-26,29101,841,39,"This video describes the difference between acute, chronic, and complex trauma. When I use the word trauma, I'm referring to trauma as it's looked at in the definition of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health disorder that requires a qualifying traumatic event. These different types of trauma are sometimes used in determining what kind of care would be appropriate or necessary. Acute trauma is also referred to as simple trauma, and this usually means when there's one traumatic event in someone's history. It would be potentially the focus of treatment or may have led to posttraumatic stress disorder. whether there was a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder or not, this would just involve one event. This could be a motor vehicle accident, a natural disaster, a workplace injury or some event that just occurs one time. Chronic trauma has multiple events. Complex trauma is often thought of as being the same thing as chronic trauma, however, with complex trauma sometimes there's an added set of criteria and that would include that the traumatic events were perpetrated by a caregiver or another trusted individual, there was a sense of betrayal, and the traumatic events happened during childhood. Regardless of the exact definition of complex trauma. the reason that this classification exists is because we believe that there is a likelihood of seeing particular symptoms or seeing more severe symptoms with complex trauma than with simple trauma. With complex trauma, it wouldn't be unusual to see relational difficulties, a sense of guilt and/or shame, low self-esteem, a distorted self-image, dissociation, difficulties regulating emotions, and a sense of hopelessness or a loss of meaning now.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

Avoidant personality disorder is a cluster C personality disorder (anxious fearful cluster). In that same cluster there is dependent personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder, like any personality disorder, is usually thought of as long lasting and pervasive. If we look at the symptom criteria for avoidant personality disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) we see a number of potential symptoms. The first is that an individual avoids an occupation because of a risk of rejection. The second symptom criterion is the individual does not want to get in relationships unless there's a certainty that they'll be liked. The third symptom criterion is individual has difficulty forming intimate relationships. This symptom really refers to the fact that they have difficulty oftentimes with that. It's not about a desire for intimate relationships, but rather the actual ability to form them. The next symptom criterion is a preoccupation with being criticized. Next is difficulty forming new relationships. An individual could have an inhibition when trying to form a new relationship. The next criterion is a feeling of being inept or inferior. The last symptom cried is the individual does not take risks because of fear of embarrassment. If we look at avoidant personality disorder we see that somebody would generally isolates because of a fear of criticism, rejection, and possibly because of embarrassment. When we think of this personality disorder, we think there's excessive monitoring of an individual's internal reactions. An individual with this disorder is often thinking about how other people are viewing them and thinking about how they could be being criticized, embarrassed, or rejected. This excessive monitoring leads to difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships.
Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with unlimited success, feeling too special to be understood by regular people, needing excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, being interpersonally exploitative, having a lack of empathy, being envious and others and believe others are envious of them, and being arrogant. Oftentimes an individual with Narcissistic Personality Disorder wants to be recognized as superior, believes they are so complex and amazing that they can only be understood by special people, has low self-esteem, devalues the contributions of others, and is condescending. Criticism is not well received by most people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Comorbid disorders include other personality disorders (e.g. Antisocial Personality Disorder), Anorexia Nervosa, and substance use disorders (especially cocaine use disorder). The prevalence of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is about 1%. Common goals in mental health treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorder include adjusting behavior to improve relationships, developing skills resolve employment and career issues, and increasing insight. Clinically significant distress is required for a diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder as stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1913,What is Alexithymia? (Inability to Express or Recognize Emotions),2018-03-24,62093,1586,118,"This video describes the concept of alexithymia. Alexithymia is a construct, which is sometimes thought of as a personality construct or condition, that involves difficulty identifying feelings or recognizing feelings or emotions in other people. Alexithymia is not a mental health disorder but it is a construct we oftentimes see when certain mental health disorders are present. We could think of alexithymia as having both internal and external components. With the internal component, we see that somebody has difficulty identifying their own feelings, describing those feelings, and expressing those feelings. There's a deficit in awareness of feeling also there's difficulty differentiating between feelings and bodily sensations. We also see a decrease in imagination and thinking is restricted to more concrete and logical than abstract. Dreams can be affected by this internal component of alexithymia. Dreams are basic and realistic as opposed to having a lot of fantasy, again consistent with the decrease in imagination. There is oftentimes increased impulsivity with alexithymia. As far as the external component, this is a failure to recognize emotions in other people, and just like the internal component, this can be specific to certain emotions. Alexithymia is on a continuum, so someone could have difficulty recognizing sadness or fear but be able to recognize enthusiasm. We see that alexithymia can be challenging because it causes suffering, it damages relationships, and can hurt careers. Even though it's not a mental health disorder it certainly has mental health consequences in a number of presentations. We can also think of alexithymia as having two dimensions, the cognitive and the affective. On the cognitive side, there is a deficit with identifying, interpreting, and describing feelings. On the affective side, it's experiencing and expressing feelings. Somebody could have a deficit in the cognitive dimension but not as much in the affective and the opposite can be true. Most times we think of alexithymia though, we think of deficits being present on both the cognitive and affective dimensions. Alexithymia is not a mental health disorder but it's often comorbid with specific mental health disorders. We tend to see alexithymia more with narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, some depressive and anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Alexithymia affects about 8% of males and 2% of females. Alexithymia can interfere with mental health treatment, so if somebody has one of those mental health disorders or another mental health disorder and alexithymia, the alexithymia can get in the way of the treatment because a lot of the mental health modalities focus on being in touch with feelings and being able to identify feelings in other people.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1914,What is the Schizophrenogenic Mother?,2018-03-22,12053,265,31,"This video describes the concept of the schizophrenogenic mother. This is a theory that was based on research that occurred in the 1930s and continued all the way through the 1970s. The word schizophrenogenic means something that causes schizophrenia. The term mother refers to the mother of an individual with schizophrenia. In this original theory, it was thought that an overprotective and rejecting mother could cause schizophrenia. The early research on this theory was in the 1930s. There was a study with 45 participants who had schizophrenia. Two of the participants had mothers that were classified as rejecting and 33 were classified as overprotective. Early on we can see there are some methodological problems with the research. There was an association drawn that really wasn't there in the first place, but this led to further studies in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. A number of these studies tended to support this theory and the idea of the schizophrenic mother was expanded. this maternal style involves someone who is dominating, cold, distant, overprotecting, rejecting, poor with maintaining boundaries, intrusive, hostile, aggressive, and demanding. The definition was expanded and the idea of the schizophrenogenic family was created. A lot of this research from the 30s all the way through the 70s used case studies and small sample sizes. Also, there were studies that did not have control groups, which means they weren't studying the maternal styles of individuals who did not have schizophrenia, rather they were only looking at the maternal styles of individuals who did have schizophrenia. These studies led to a real commitment to this belief and the theory was popular for a long time. In the 70s and 80s we saw studies come out that started to question the schizophrenogenic mother theory and suggested that there really wasn't hardly any association between that maternal style and the developing of schizophrenia. For a long time, the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother was based on the idea that this maternal style was overrepresented with people who had schizophrenia and it turns out it really wasn't. 
There are a lot of lessons to learn from the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother. This theory was popular for around 40 years even though there was little evidence to support it. This speaks to the importance of good research methodology and careful interpretation of research results. We have to be careful when converting association or correlation over to causality. Those constructs aren't the same, however, this seems to be a common mistake in a number of fields including mental health treatment and psychopathology.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

Paranoid delusions are a symptom of a few mental health disorders including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. A delusion is a strongly held belief that is clearly false, but that is not the entirety of the definition. A number of people that do not have schizophrenia or another disorder with delusions, have strongly held beliefs that are false. In order for a strongly held belief to qualify as a delusion, it would also have to be not understandable in the context of one's educational, cultural, and social background.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

Avoidant personality disorder has comorbidity with other mental health disorders. Comorbidity means is it tends to co-occur with other disorders. Just because avoidant personality disorder is comorbid with any particular disorder doesn't mean that they'll always appear together. It simply means there's an elevated risk that they'll come occur. Comorbid disorders include other personality disorders from cluster C (dependent an obsessive compulsive), anxiety disorders posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders. 
Possible etiological factors for avoidant personality disorder include genetics, trauma, physical abuse, and neglect. Lower levels of the expression of parental love and pride, parental intolerance, and guilt-engendering parental behavior are also associated with the development of avoidant personality disorder.  A trait named behavioral inhibition is associated with avoidant personality disorder. Behavioral inhibition includes shyness, avoiding new experiences, avoiding strangers, and increased sensitivity and anxiety reactivity. Behavioral inhibition is a temperamental factor that is largely thought of as genetic.
One theory of why neglect and abuse and behavioral inhibition appear to be tied to the development of avoidant personality disorder is that the neglect and emotional abuse caused feelings of worthlessness. A person can feel that they are re not worthy of being loved because of the way they were treated. they don't see others as safe or supportive as they grow up so they tend to develop feelings of mistrust. This mistrust can be viewed as arrogant and it can make other people not want to interact with that individual. This leads to increased isolation, which leads back to a lower level of trust. There is a cycle that gets started with the abuse and the neglect and carries on into adolescence and adulthood.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1917,What are Counting Rituals in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?,2018-03-18,29030,667,83,"This video describes counting rituals in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). When we talk about counting rituals in OCD a lot of times what we're talking about is a type of obsession and compulsion related to checking. An individual will count something a certain number of times in order to check it. Often these checking obsessions and compulsions are tied to safety. There are the two parts to OCD: obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions increase anxiety and compulsions, in theory, decrease anxiety. In certain presentations, OCD appears to only have obsessions, but really if we look more closely at those presentations, we see that it's a mental compulsion that's occurring as opposed to a regular compulsion. Oftentimes, counting obsessions are centered around safety. We see objects like light switches, for example. A light switch will be turned on and off a particular number of times or the individual will push down on the light switch so many times. We also can look at other types of switches as well, for example, with light switches have a dimmer. Here you might see somebody turning the dimmer all the way down to all the way up. Switches on electronic devices may be manipulated too. Locks are a common focus of counting rituals. It may be a lock on a door to a house, but it can be a car, shed, filing cabinet, or anything that has a lock. Another area we see counting rituals with safety is with ovens and other appliances. If an oven is electric or gas, the burner can be turned on and off so many times and again this is to make sure it's actually off. Some of the counting rituals are not as clearly tied to safety. For example, having to walk in and out of a room so many times before somebody walks out of the room for the final time. The number used in counting rituals may be constant or change.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1918,What is an Existential Obsession (Philosophical Obsession) in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?,2018-03-16,26282,950,107,"This video describes existential obsessions, which are sometimes observed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Existential obsessions are also referred to as “philosophical obsessions.” In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), we see obsessions and compulsions. An obsession is a thought that is disturbing to an individual who has OCD. With the case of existential obsessions, the thoughts center around existential or philosophical topics. Somebody can have existential obsessions and other types of obsessions and compulsions. With existential obsessions, there's a preoccupation with existential topics like the meaning of life, the nature of God, questioning the existence of God, the nature of the universe, how the universe started, the nature of reality and consciousness, and what happens when somebody dies. We also see an interest in science like physics, biology, or chemistry, usually in an effort to explain how people exist. There is sometimes an interest in morality. There are various reactions to these existential obsessions and some of these reactions we would consider compulsions. It is not unusual for someone with these obsessions to look for reassurance. If they select a particular point of view, the may look for reassurance that they're correct from people they believe might know those answers. There are sometimes attempts to answer the existential question. 
Existential and philosophical obsessions are often thought of as ruminations as opposed to intrusive thoughts. Intrusive thoughts are different than ruminations. An intrusive thought is disturbing and people try to avoid these thoughts. Intrusive thoughts oftentimes have a sexual, violent, relational, or religious nature to them and the individual with OCD who has these thoughts considers them undesirable. A rumination is typically not resisted like an intrusive thought would be. Someone who has ruminations does not consider the ruminations to be offensive or even troubling. Ruminations are a series of thoughts that go on for days, months, or even years. Existential obsessions, therefore, could be thought of as existential ruminations. Sometimes depression and anxiety associated with these existential ruminations.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

Some possible causes for narcissistic personality disorder in genetics (heritability), brain structure, and stressors (environmentability). Heritability accounts for somewhere between 40% and 65% to the development of NPD. Some structural changes in the brain have also been identified. Experiences in early childhood may also contribute to the development of narcissistic personality disorder. Risk factors include when a child receives excessive praise and also excessive criticism, lack of parental empathy, praise for abilities or appearance instead of other characteristics, and an emphasis on status or achieving success. Other potential ideological factors include emotional abuse and neglect.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

1921,What are Hit and Run Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder? (MVA OCD),2018-03-12,18761,390,28,"This video describes what is referred to as “hit-and-run OCD.” This term refers to a type of obsession we sometimes see with obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's also referred to as MVA OCD or motor vehicle accident obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's a type of obsession we see sometimes with OCD.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder has obsessions, which are intrusive thoughts, and/or compulsions. Compulsions are behaviors that, in theory, relieve anxiety. There's a lot of variety with the types of obsessions we see with OCD. Some are checking obsessions, others are based on contamination, and others are strictly intrusive thoughts. There are other categories as well for obsessions. The concern over hitting someone with the car is really a type of checking obsession, but it could also be an intrusive thought. When talking about obsessions in OCD, it's important to recognize there's a wide variety of obsessions and a number of these obsessions look like symptoms of an anxiety disorder or depressive disorder. This “hit-and-run” type obsession is no exception. Comorbidity with OCD is pronounced. About 76% of individuals with OCD will also have an anxiety disorder at some point in their life, and about 63% will have a depressive disorder. OCD is different than obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, although 25% of individuals with OCD will also have obsessive-compulsive personality disorder at some point in their life. It's also important to recognize that if somebody has this motor vehicle-related obsession, that doesn't mean they necessarily have obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are other symptom criteria in order to be diagnosed with OCD. For example, the obsessions or compulsions have to be time consuming and there needs to be clinically significant distress. There are other requirements as well. So again, having this obsession doesn't mean OCD is present, rather it's just a type of obsession we sometimes see. MVA OCD is not the same thing as a fear of driving and it's not a fear of having a panic attack while driving. Specifically, it's a fear of the consequences of hitting a pedestrian, but is could also be a pet or another car. The way we typically see this manifest is in terms of a pedestrian and oftentimes the thought is that a child may have been hit with a car. somebody with this particular obsession may be driving down the road and they may hear a sound or hit a pothole. They believe that they've hit a child. The first thing they may do is check the rearview mirror to see if they see anything. Then they may pull over and inspect the passenger side of their vehicle, specifically the front bumper, to look again for any evidence that some sort of accident occurred. After that they may drive back around and check to see if there's somebody there. They may also listen for sirens like from the police or an ambulance. They may look on the Internet later on to see if there's been accident reported or they could check the newspaper. After that they may return again to this scene where they think something happened and drive around. This behavior could take hours.
There's a clearly disruptive component to this obsession just like we see with other obsessions. This obsession can also manifest in a variety of other ways other than a concern over hitting a pedestrian a child. Sometimes there's a concern over hitting another car. There is also a version of this obsession where somebody is concerned that a part of their car fell off and a car behind them ran over that object. 
There a variety of potential consequences for the individual who has this obsession. They could increase the risk of an accident by driving around the area where they thought they hit somebody. Also, there's a tendency when somebody's driving around like this to park or stop their car in unusual places to investigate what they thought was an accident scene. This increases the risk of causing a real accident. Other consequences include the avoiding of driving in the future, only driving in the daylight or good weather conditions, and only driving with a passenger.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1922,What are Flashbacks? (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD] - Intrusion Symptom),2018-03-10,48142,1478,57,"This video explains the concept of a flashback, which is a symptom associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When we look at the definition of PTSD, we can divide the symptoms into five categories: qualifying trauma, intrusive symptoms, avoidance symptoms, negative mood, and arousal and reactivity. Flashbacks would be part of intrusive symptoms, which is otherwise known as intrusion. Flashbacks are re-experiencing episodes that are involuntary, recurrent, and can have physiological, emotional, and sensory components to them. Not all re-experiencing is a flashback. Sometimes re-experiencing only involves memories or dreams. When there is re-experiencing and that is accompanied by a dissociative state, sometimes this qualifies an episode as a flashback. During a flashback an individual may behave as if the traumatic event is happening currently. This can have a number of components: physiological (e.g. sweating, increased heartrate), emotional (e.g. feelings of fear, depression, anxiety), and sensory (e.g. visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory). Somebody can see, hear, touch, and smell the elements in a flashback potentially. Sometimes we see some of those senses are functioning during a flashback and other ones would not be. For example, some flashbacks are only visual. Sometimes flashbacks do not have a memory component or a sensory component, but only an emotional component. These are referred to as an emotional flashback. Emotional flashbacks as more associated with trauma that occurs in early childhood as opposed to later in life. There is some controversy around flashbacks and how they might relate to dissociation. A lot of times we think of a flashback as a dissociative state, but there is research that shows that flashbacks and dissociation may be completely separate constructs. There is various research using brain scans that show that different areas of the brain are active during a flashback than we see with dissociation. We don’t know what causes flashbacks, however, there are a number of theories about what may be going on in the brain that could lead to flashbacks. One of the more popular theories is that traumatic experiences are encoded in the brain differently than other experiences, so they are more prone to result in a flashback than a non-traumatic memory.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande

A number of modern modalities have some sort of theory associated with them. Solution-Focused Therapy is not theory driven. It is considered a positive approach that's also considered a constructivist approach. Solution-Focused Therapy is considered to be collaborative and collegial as opposed to confrontational, instructive, or needing to have an interpretation component. Many of the modern theories that we see do have confrontational, instructive, and interpretive components to them. Even though Solution-Focused Therapy is not theory based, there are principles and techniques associated with it. The first is that problems form in the context of human interaction. This is a bit different than reality therapy for instance, which looks at problems formed because of relationships. In Solution-Focused Therapy interactions could include relationships, but they're not exclusively relationships. The objective in Solution-Focused Therapy is to encourage a client to do something different, so there is the idea here that any change is a good change. Any change moves somebody further away from the problem. We recognize in mental health treatment that all change isn't good. There can be negative change as well. For example, if someone comes into treatment because they are consuming too much alcohol and the change they make is to consume more alcohol. That would be recognized as negative. In Solution-Focused Therapy there isn't really an emphasis on directionality, although generally of course, a positive change would be recognized as superior to a negative change. In Solution-Focused Therapy, the client is the expert. The modality does recognize that in all therapy there is a hierarchy, but the wisdom of the client is seen as the most valuable contribution to the therapeutic process. The therapist is not an expert and again there's no real instructive component to this therapy. One of the goals of therapists in Solution-Focused Therapy is to help the client to make contact with forgotten and unnoticed wisdom. The client comes to therapy with everything they need to make the change that would eliminate the problem. We see this component in other therapeutic modalities as well to some extent. It is in Person-Centered Therapy, Reality Therapy, and a component in a number of other therapeutic modalities. Another feature of Solution-Focused Therapy is that resistance helps the therapists to know how to help the client. Resistance is interpreted as positive it adds knowledge to the therapeutic process. With resistance being thought of as valuable, Solution-Focused Therapy is similar to motivational interviewing. To deal with resistance the therapist tries to build cooperation. This is done by connecting the present to the future. The past is largely ignored in Solution-Focused Therapy, except for exceptions to the problem. This would be when the problem was not around. Another technique in Solution-Focused Therapy is reframing. This technique is very similar to what we see in some cognitive behavioral therapies like Beckian Cognitive Therapy or Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy developed by Albert Ellis. So new meaning can be developed as the therapist listens to the client’s narrative. This new meaning would be conveyed to the client and potentially result in the problem being eliminated or being reduced in severity. Goals in Solution-Focused Therapy need to be small and achievable. There are a number of techniques that are fairly popular with Solution-Focused Therapy including the miracle question, exception to the problem, and scaling.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1926,What is Major Depressive Disorder?,2018-03-05,52755,1700,56,"This video describes Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Major Depressive Disorder has symptom criteria as well as some other criteria. A diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires at least one major depressive episode. It's not unusual for individuals with Major Depressive Disorder to have had multiple major depressive episodes through the course of their lifetime. When we look at the definition for Major Depressive Disorder in the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, we see a number of symptom criteria. Five or more of these symptoms criteria need to be met in the last two weeks, however, with the first two symptom criteria, one of those two symptom criteria must be present. The first symptom criterion is depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day. The second is markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. This symptom must be present most of the day, nearly every day. Other symptom criteria include weight gain or weight loss, too much or too little sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, trouble concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death. In addition to the symptom criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, there are four other criteria: there needs to be clinically significant distress, the disturbance can't be better explained through substance use or medical condition or from schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other related psychotic disorders, and there can never have been a manic episode in the individual’s history. If there's a major depressive episode and a manic episode in the history, Bipolar Disorder would be considered rather than Major Depressive Disorder. The 12-month prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder the United States is around 7% and females are more likely to be diagnosed with this disorder than males, however, the course and the treatment response for Major Depressive Disorder is about the same for females and males.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1927,What is Psychoanalytic Theory (Psychoanalysis)?,2018-03-04,65371,1519,26,"This video describes psychoanalytic theory, which is a talk therapy modality that was developed by Sigmund Freud. It needs to be differentiated from psychodynamic theory. Psychodynamic theory includes psychoanalytic theory as well as the work that's been done since Sigmund Freud's work Neo-Freudians). Psychodynamic theory of course uses many of the same principles we see in psychoanalytic theory but they're not exactly the same thing. The process of using psychoanalytic theory is referred to as psychoanalysis. Tt has several components to it that are fairly distinct from other therapeutic modalities. The first is the idea of levels of awareness. In psychoanalytic theory there are three levels of awareness: conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. The conscious mind contains information that someone's thinking right now. The preconscious mind contains information that is retrievable, but not in conscious awareness. The unconscious mind is the largest and it contains the most information. It contains information about frightening experiences, painful experiences, or drives that are unacceptable. In psychoanalytic theory, all symptoms come from unresolved unconscious conflicts. The next component is the psyche. In psychoanalytic theory, the psyche is divided into three components:  id, ego, and superego. The id has two instincts: Eros and the Thanatos. The Eros is the life instinct and the Thanatos is the death instinct. The Eros is focused on survival, so it has components like eating, breathing, and having sex. The Thanatos is focused on self-destruction, so it's the death instinct, and has elements like violence and aggression. Freud believed that the Eros was more powerful in most people than the Thanatos, so generally people would move in a positive direction. The ego is a mediator between the id and the superego. Tt functions on the reality principle. It tries to balance those basic needs with morality. When the ego fails, defense mechanisms are created. The superego, which is the last component of the psyche to develop, contains morality and the rules of society. The next component of psychoanalytic theory is the psychosexual stages, and according to Freud there were five stages of development: oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. 
Defense mechanisms are thought to lower anxiety, but eventually can lead to dysfunction if they are overused. Denial is when someone won't acknowledge something that's true. Sublimation is when undesirable urges are converted into a useful career or a useful hobby. An example of displacement is when an individual is bullied and they develop aggressive feelings toward that bully, but they take out those feelings on someone who is not intimidating. They are displacing that aggression intended for the bully to someone else. Regression is tied in with the psychosexual stages. Regression is when a person moves to an earlier stage of development and they adopt the behaviors that are consistent with that stage. Potentially they would revisit the conflicts with that stage. Fixation the next defense mechanism. It is when somebody gets stuck at a particular stage, so they stay within that conflict that's consistent with that stage and don't move forward. Repression is arguably the most important defense mechanism, because the goal of all defense mechanisms is to accomplish some degree of repression. Repression is when material from the conscious mind or the preconscious mind is moved over into the unconscious mind. 
Freud developed a number of techniques for psychoanalytic theory including catharsis, interpretation of dreams, free association, analysis of resistance, and transference. Countertransference is not part of the treatment and it's considered destructive. It is when the therapist projects feelings onto the client. In psychoanalytic theory transference was valuable and was analyzed and countertransference was avoided.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1928,What are Repressed Memories and are they real?,2018-03-02,29393,1059,55,"This video describes the concept of repressed memories and the defense mechanism of repression. Repression is one of the defense mechanisms theorized by Sigmund Freud when he created psychoanalytic theory, which is a talk therapy modality. In psychoanalytic theory, the ego regulates the unconscious drives of the id and the morals and societal values of the superego. When the ego fails to regulate the id and the superego sometimes defense mechanisms can be observed. One of those defense mechanisms is repression and arguably it's the most important defense mechanism because every defense mechanism has repression reflected in it in some way. To understand repression we have to understand the idea of the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious mind. The conscious mind contains information that we are aware of right now. The preconscious mind stores more information that we have access to but we are not thinking of at the moment. That information can be retrieved. The unconscious mind contains the most information and it's information that we are not aware of we can't retrieve. With repression, frightening and painful memories, thoughts, or unconscious drives that are unacceptable get pushed from conscious awareness or from the preconscious mind to the unconscious mind. By definition someone cannot recall a repressed memory. They are not aware of the information that is stored away securely in the unconscious mind. On this issue of the existence of repressed memories, most therapists believe that this phenomenon is true (about 70%). Most researchers don't believe it's true with only around 15 - 30% believing that repressed memories are real. There are a number of alternative explanations to repressed memories, however, research in this area is difficult to conduct. There is no way currently of proving or disproving the concept of repressed memories.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1929,Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy vs. Cognitive Therapy? (REBT vs .CT),2018-03-01,42638,832,23,"This video describes the differences between Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT; Albert Ellis) and Cognitive Therapy (CT, Aaron Beck).
REBT is a therapeutic modality that was developed by Albert Ellis. It is a version of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioral therapy is a general term that refers to a number of specific modalities that emphasize the role of cognition (thinking) and behavior (doing) in the treatment of mental health symptoms. REBT and cognitive therapy (CT; developed by Aaron Beck) are the two most popular versions of CBT, although there are many other versions of CBT as well. REBT is based on the idea that cognitive affective and behavioral processes can be manipulated to reduce symptoms. Albert Ellis referred to the affective processes as “emotive,” hence the name rational emotive behavior therapy. Another key component of REBT is the idea that the perception of circumstances do not cause symptoms, but rather the individual’s perception of circumstances cause symptoms. REBT considers the therapist to be an expert and someone who promotes rational thinking. In REBT, rational thinking can eventually change feelings, behavior, and thoughts and result in a reduction of symptoms. REBT is considered a humanistic modality. Ellis believed that individuals are goal-directed and he saw the human condition and therapy as positive. Ellis did not believe in judging the individual, but rather he judged the behavior. Ellis developed an ABC model. “A” is the Activating Event, “B” is the Belief, and “C” is the Consequence. The Activating Event as a stressor. The belief system is what a person uses to interpret the stressor. The results of the stressor being processed with a belief are the consequences. Consequences can lead back to an Activating Event, so the ABC model can become a cycle. Ellis had a number of techniques in addition to this ABC model, including role-playing, shame attacking exercises, reframing, homework, and humor.
Cognitive Therapy is a therapeutic modality that was developed by Aaron Beck. Cognitive Therapy is based on the idea that we can change our thoughts and our behavior and that will result in changes in feelings. Cognitive Therapy can be used to treat mental health symptoms and mental health disorders. This theory is arguably the most popular version of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The cognitive model presented in cognitive therapy is fairly precise. It starts with the idea of the core belief. The core belief is a belief that is deeply held and usually relatively simple. It is formed through childhood experiences and most core beliefs are positive, however in the model of cognitive therapy, the types of core beliefs that lead to problems are usually negative. When we have core beliefs these automatically generate intermediate beliefs. Core beliefs are deeply held and intermediate beliefs are somewhere between core beliefs and automatic thoughts. Intermediate beliefs are attitudes, rules, and expectations, that individuals have. Sometimes these can be distorted if the core belief is inaccurate. Inaccurate intermediate beliefs are carried around by individuals and when they encounter stressors then automatic thoughts come into existence. These are thoughts that just pop into somebody's mind. Most automatic thoughts are helpful and positive, however the ones that are based on negative core beliefs and usually negative. These automatic thoughts lead to reaction. Reactions are affective, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological. Sometimes these reactions can become another stressful event that is combined with another intermediate belief to form a new automatic thought. The cognitive triad is the idea that a lot of mental health symptoms come into being because people have distorted views of themselves, others, and the world. Cognitive distortions are consistent errors in thinking. There are a number of techniques in cognitive therapy including the therapeutic alliance, evaluating evidence, and self-talk (adaptive response). The adaptive response fits into the cognitive model. It is between the automatic thought and the reaction. In theory, if a person has an automatic thought and applies and adaptive response the reaction will change. This disrupts the cycle and leads to symptom reduction. Challenging core beliefs is a technique of cognitive therapy, however, it is not common as core beliefs are considered to be again fairly deeply held.",Mar,Dr. Todd Grande
1930,What is Motivational Interviewing?,2018-02-28,28906,588,14,"Motivational interviewing is a therapeutic modality that was developed by a researcher named Miller in the 1980s specifically to treat substance use disorders. Since that time another researcher named Rollnick has worked with Miller to advance the theory. Motivational interviewing is quite a bit different than a lot of other modalities. It is a brief therapy and is narrowly focused on substance use or sometimes other issues where motivation is considered central to making some sort of change. In motivational interviewing, the therapist works to expand the gap between the choices an individual is making and their behaviors and goals. Therapists using motivational interviewing will help a client explore that ambivalence. Ambivalence is when an individual has strong feelings in opposite directions. In motivational interviewing a therapist rolls with resistance. The stages of change in motivational interviewing are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (sometimes a sixth stage added like relapse and termination). One acronym used in motivational interviewing OARS: open questions, affirmation, reflective listening, and summary. Another acronym is RULE: resist the righting reflex, understanding the client’s own motivation, listen with empathy, and empower.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande
1931,Is Major Depression Overdiagnosed or Underdiagnosed?,2018-02-27,4994,112,9,"This video discusses Major Depressive Disorder and how it could be overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed. One of the confusing elements around overdiagnosis is the definition. The definition of over diagnosis and mental health is different than we see in medicine. The definition for overdiagnosis originated in medicine and now we use it in mental health, however, they really do not mean the same thing. An overdiagnosis in medicine is actually a correct diagnosis that occurs in an individual who would never develop symptoms or die from the disorder. In mental health the way we use overdiagnosis is usually to mean an unacceptably high false positive rate. Using major depressive disorder as an example, this would be when an individual does not have major depressive disorder, but they are assessed and the assessment shows that they do have the disorder. So in actuality they do not have it, however the assessment indicates they do. That is a false positive. An overdiagnosis would occur when the false positive rate becomes unacceptably high. Underdiagnosis in mental health would be an unacceptably high false negative rate. In a 2013 study with a large sample over 5000 participants who had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, only about 38% of the participants were correctly diagnosed with major depressive disorder. About 62% of his individuals would represent a false positive. The same article also discussed underdiagnosis as a problem with major depressive disorder.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

1933,What is Reality Therapy? (Choice Theory),2018-02-25,63288,1127,41,"This video describes Reality Therapy. Reality Therapy is a therapeutic modality that was developed by William Glasser and it is based on a philosophy he also developed called Choice Theory. Reality Therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that emphasizes, needs, behavior, thinking, taking responsibility, and relationships. Reality Therapy is based on a few different needs: survival, freedom, fun, love and belonging, and power. In Reality Therapy, love and belonging is the most important need and power is expressed as a more negative need. All behavior is chosen and behavior is the only thing that is under direct control. Problems occur when people use external control when they try to meet the need for power, but in a negative way. This leads to frustration, conflict, and disconnected relationships. According to Reality Therapy disconnected relationships are the cause of all long lasting mental health symptoms. One of the goals include taking responsibility, generating a new perspective, and developing a specific plan to reconnect with other people. In Reality Therapy, there are seven deadly habits and seven caring habits. The seven deadly habits are criticizing, blaming, complaining, nagging, threatening, punishing, and bribing or rewarding in order to exert control. The seven caring habits are supporting, encouraging, listening, accepting, trusting, respecting, and negotiating differences. To the extent that somebody can reduce their deadly habits and increase their caring habits, they can improve relationships and, in theory, reduce mental health symptoms. Another idea in Reality Therapy is total behavior. This comprises doing, thinking, feeling, and physiology. Feeling and physiology are looked at as difficult to directly control, and doing and thinking our thought of as much easier to control. In Reality Therapy almost all the activity starts with doing or acting and then moves to thinking, with feeling and physiology worked on later.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

Social anxiety disorder is a disorder that involves fear, anxiety, and sometimes panic when social situations occur. The definition of social anxiety disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) includes several criteria: fear in social situations where there is a possibility of exposure to scrutiny, fear of acting in a way that will result in negative evaluation, social situations almost always result in anxiety or fear, social situations are avoided or they are endured with intense anxiety or fear, the anxiety and fear are out of proportion to the actual threat, the disturbance lasts longer than six months, clinically significant distress and social occupational or other areas, and it cannot be better explained by substance use disorder, another mental health disorder, or a medical disorder. There are instances where individuals have social anxiety disorder but it only relates to performing (e.g. public speaking). The specifier associated with this is “performance only.” The 12-month prevalence in the United States for social anxiety disorder is 7% and the median age of onset is 13. This disorder is sometimes comorbid with obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, major depressive disorder, and substance use disorder.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

Narrative therapy seeks to modify a problem-saturated story into a more productive story. Part of the idea behind narrative therapy is that identity is formed by the narrative of a person’s life. In narrative therapy there is no diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or from any source. The role of the therapist in narrative therapy is that of an investigative reporter or non-directive collaborator. The therapist in this modality is extremely curious about the narrative and particularly the client’s perception of the narrative. Narrative therapy attempts to externalize the problem. A phrase that is popular narrative therapy is “the person is not the problem, the problem is the problem.” Narrative therapy is a postmodern and constructivist approach.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

Existential therapy, in theory, treats the existential crisis and a number of other concerns. Often these concerns have philosophical underpinnings similar to an existential crisis. Existential therapy is informed by existential philosophy, but the two are not the same thing. Existential therapy is a therapeutic modality used to treat different concerns about existence and meaning and purpose as well as mental health concerns and mental health symptoms. Existential therapy is an honest and direct therapy it is appropriate for individuals from diverse backgrounds. It discusses a subject matter that is difficult for individuals to discuss with friends or family, like the meaning of life, the inevitability of death, and isolation.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

Agreeableness is a personality trait in the five-factor model of personality traits, which is also known as “The Big Five” model of personality. In this model, personality comprises five personality traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The acronym OCEAN is helpful for remembering the personality traits. Openness to experience is characterized by insight, creativity, an appreciation of art, intellectual curiosity, and a high awareness of feelings. Conscientiousness is characterized by impulse control, planning tasks carefully, being highly organized and prudence. Extraversion is characterized by getting energy from social interaction, talkativeness, and having a large number of acquaintances. Agreeableness is characterized by being cooperative, increased level of caring, empathy, friendly, seeking to compromise. Neuroticism is characterized by mood dysregulation, anxiety, worry, depression, frustrating, nervousness, being easily upset, and low emotional stability.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande
1941,The Four Schedules of Reinforcement in Behaviorism,2018-02-15,7071,109,13,This video describes the four reinforcement schedules from behavior therapy. The terms fixed (every n times or n amount or time) and variable (variable number of responses or variable amount of time) are combined with ratio (based on the number of responses) and interval (based on time) to generate the four schedules. A Fixed Ratio system of reinforcement schedule reinforces every nth response. Fixed Ratio schedules are ideal for optimizing quantity over quality. A Fixed Interval reinforces every n amount of time. Fixed Interval schedules are ideal for optimizing quality over quantity. Variable Ratio schedules reinforce at a varying number of responses. Variable Interval schedules reinforce at varying amounts of time. Fixed schedules are easy to extinguish and easy to learn. Variable schedules taking longer to learn and are more resistant to extinction.,Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

Adlerian therapy is a complex therapy that has a number of components from other theories and modalities. Adlerian therapy has a family contextual component, holds that individuals are striving to be successful, and includes the inferiority complex and the superiority complex. In Adlerian therapy, emphasis is placed on birth order and a theorized relationship to personality Adlerian therapy includes the value of childhood memories and experiences to inform counseling.

1943,What is Behavior Therapy?,2018-02-13,58863,824,22,"This video describes behavior therapy. Behavior therapy is a therapeutic modality based on behaviorism. Behaviorism is a fairly strict theory that reduces all learning to stimulus and response. There are consequences for a behavior and these consequences either increase the probability that behavior will occur again or decrease the probability that the behavior will occur again. With strict behaviorism there is no internal state. Thoughts, moods, feelings, and free will are not important or do not exist in behaviorism. With behaviorism, there are no complex mental processes and insight is of little value. Behavior therapy does not adopt all of the components of the theory of behaviorism. Behavior therapy combines components of behaviorism and parts of mental health treatment modalities.
Stimulus and response can be divided into two categories: classical conditioning and operant conditioning. To conceptualize classical conditioning, it is important to understand that it is based really on pairing a stimulus that would not normally cause response (conditioned stimulus) with a stimulus that would normally cause a response (unconditioned stimulus). Operant conditioning is based on reinforcement and punishment. Operant conditioning has behavior that is reinforced but there is nothing unconditioned in terms of the stimulus. Techniques that are used in behavioral therapy include shaping, systematic desensitization, flooding, establishing a token economy, and the Premack principle.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

1945,What is Analytic Psychology? (Jungian Therapy),2018-02-11,69892,1896,58,"This video describes Analytic Psychology, which is a theory that was developed by Carl Jung and sometimes is referred to as analytic therapy. Carl Jung was a colleague of Freud and he broke with Freud over his vision of personality theory and his vision of what caused and maintained symptoms. Analytic Psychology is a complex therapy and it has a number of parts that are fairly unconventional when compared to other popular theories like cognitive behavioral therapy, reality therapy, and existential therapy. All of those different modalities have components that are a little different between them, however, there are a lot of similarities. Analytic Psychology stands out as being quite a bit different. Carl Jung looked at the ego as how one sees oneself and as self-regulating. Freud looked at the ego as mediating the ID (basic drives and urges) and the Superego (morality and social norms). Carl Jung theorized levels of consciousness. He postulated the existence of the conscious mind, the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. Carl Jung envisioned the conscious mind as the gatekeeper to consciousness. The personal unconscious contains thoughts, ideas, and memories that were repressed or forgotten. The collective unconscious has concepts that are shared across generations now. Carl Jung did not believe that the collective unconscious was inherited but rather shared. He did believe, however, that there was a predisposition to have certain types of archetypes including the anima, animus, persona, and shadow. Techniques of Jungian therapy include free association, dream analysis, catharsis, the use of art, word association, and the interpretation of transference.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

ADHD is characterized by symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity including impulsivity, fidgeting, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, mood swings, limited attention span, trouble focusing, excitability, and boredom. ADHD has three subtypes: Predominantly Inattentive Presentation, Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation, and Combined Presentation. The Predominantly Hyperactive / Impulsive Subtype has nine symptom criteria: fidgeting, leaves when sitting is expected, run and climbs when inappropriate (feeling restless in adults), unable to play quietly (unable to engage in leisure activities quietly in adults), on the go as if driven by a motor, talks excessively, answers questions before completed, difficulty waiting for one’s turn, often interrupts. Several symptoms need to be present before the age of 12 to qualify for the diagnosis. Clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with functioning is required.
Subtypes are mutually exclusive and jointly (collectively) exhaustive. If an individual has a mental health diagnosis that contains subtypes, they would be assigned one and only one subtype. Only one subtype can ever be assigned (mutually exclusive, having one rules out the others) and one subtype must be assigned (jointly exhaustive, the subtypes cover all of the possible presentations). The term “specify whether” indicates a subtype is required. Specifiers may be mutually exclusive, but are not always. The may also be jointly exhaustive, however, they are not in every case. Specifiers usually provide more information about course (e.g. in remission), severity (e.g. mild, moderate, severe, extreme), or descriptive features (e.g. in a controlled environment). The terms “specify if” or “specify” are used to indicate a specifier may be assigned.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

The “five layers of neuroses” (phony, phobic, impasse, implosive, explosive) could be stripped away through Gestalt Therapy and an individual could be more authentic. Unexpressed feelings (unfinished business) and not taking responsibility could also lead to symptoms according to Gestalt Therapy. Gestalt Therapy has several techniques including confrontation, which is one of the more controversial techniques. Gestalt Therapy is focused on the here and now. The empty chair and two chair techniques are particularly popular in Gestalt Therapy and are versions of “self-dialogue.” Role-playing and enactment are sometimes used in Gestalt Therapy as well. Many of the Gestalt Therapy techniques are integrated into a number of other therapeutic modalities.",Feb,Dr. Todd Grande

The False Consensus Effect is an effect where people tend to think that others have the same feelings, thoughts, motive, and values. The False Consensus Effect is not an unconscious process.
Defense mechanisms, as described by Freud, protect the ego from unconscious drives, thoughts, and impulses that are unacceptable to society, like greed, aggression, and sexual desires. Defense mechanisms keep the unacceptable drives out of conscious awareness. Theoretically, if defense mechanisms operate for too long a time, they can lead to psychopathology or mental health symptoms in general.

Cognitive Dissonance Theory was developed by a researcher named Leon Festinger in the 1950’s. Cognitive dissonance occurs when someone’s beliefs are different from their actions. Cognitive dissonance leads to discomfort and, in theory, to change in beliefs and/or behavior. The Principle of Cognitive Consistency states that individuals are sensitive to cognitive dissonance. The level of cognitive dissonance is based on how strongly beliefs are held. There are a few ways to alleviate cognitive dissonance including changing the behavior, changing the belief, or changing both. In some situations, individuals may be unwilling or unable to change a belief or action, so the cognitive dissonance remains along with the corresponding discomfort, tension, or anxiety.

Sublimation is considered a mature defense mechanism and it is often thought of as a positive defense mechanism. Many of the defense mechanism are thought of as negative. Sublimation takes the unacceptable urges, impulses, and thoughts that reside in the unconscious mind and converts them into socially acceptable, positive behavior. This is often thought of in terms of career choice. For example, someone with aggressive urges could become an athlete. Someone with unacceptable sexual desires may sublimate that desire into creativity by being an artist. With the defense mechanism of sublimation, there is typically congruence between the unacceptable drive and the career choice.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande

Galatzer-Levy and Bryant published a study in 2013 that answered the same question and generated the same number.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1976,What is the Difference Between DSM Subtypes & Specifiers?,2018-01-10,13662,210,23,"This video describes the difference between subtypes and specifiers for mental health disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Subtypes are mutually exclusive and jointly (collectively) exhaustive. If an individual has a mental health diagnosis that contains subtypes, they would be assigned one and only one subtype. Only one subtype can ever be assigned (mutually exclusive, having one rules out the others) and one subtype must be assigned (jointly exhaustive, the subtypes cover all of the possible presentations). The term “specify whether” indicates a subtype is required. Specifiers may be mutually exclusive, but are not always. The may also be jointly exhaustive, however, they are not in every case. Specifiers usually provide more information about course (e.g. in remission), severity (e.g. mild, moderate, severe, extreme), or descriptive features (e.g. in a controlled environment). The terms “specify if” or “specify” are used to indicate a specifier may be assigned.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1977,The Relationship between the Five-Factor Model and Mental Health Disorders,2018-01-09,27236,956,49,"This video describes the association between the Five-Factor Model of Personality Traits and mental health disorders.
A popular way to conceptualize personality is with the five-factor model of personality traits, which is also known as “The Big Five” model of personality. In this model, personality comprises five personality traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The acronym OCEAN is helpful for remembering the personality traits. Openness to experience is characterized by insight, creativity, an appreciation of art, intellectual curiosity, and a high awareness of feelings. Conscientiousness is characterized by impulse control, planning tasks carefully, being highly organized and prudence. Extraversion is characterized by getting energy from social interaction, talkativeness, and having a large number of acquaintances. Agreeableness is characterized by being cooperative, increased level of caring, empathy, friendly, seeking to compromise. Neuroticism is characterized by mood dysregulation, anxiety, worry, depression, frustrating, nervousness, being easily upset, and low emotional stability.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1978,What is Anhedonia?,2018-01-08,65519,1789,102,"This video describes the term “anhedonia.” Anhedonia is from the Greek and means “without pleasure.” It is characterized by a loss of interest in activities. Physical anhedonia is characterized by diminished pleasure in food, sex, hobbies, work-related activities, etc. Social anhedonia is characterized by diminished pleasure in social activities. Anticipatory anhedonia is when the pleasure of anticipation is diminished. Consummatory anhedonia is a reduction in enjoyment during the actual time of consumption. Anhedonia is a key component of several mental disorders including Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Substance Use Disorder, and PTSD.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1979,Can Nonverbal Communication Reveal Deception?,2018-01-07,4169,177,20,"This video describes the theory that nonverbal communication can indicate deception. There is a common belief that certain groups (e.g. mental health clinicians, police officers, judges, jurors) have an enhanced ability to identify deceptive behavior through the observations of nonverbal behaviors like micro-expressions. Evidence does not support this theory, however, some micro-expressions and behaviors have a small association with deceptive behavior. Some micro-expressions are touching the nose, touching the face, adjusting eyeglasses, pushing hair back behind the ear, covering the mouth or eyes, looking left, looking right, and touch the neck. Some behaviors that have a small association with deception are telling inconsistent stories, claiming to have a memory problem, speaking slowly, and reluctance to offer details. The effect size is too small to use nonverbal behavior to detect lying for any meaningful purpose.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1980,"Epidemiology, Etiology, and Risk Factors in Mental Health",2018-01-06,5865,102,27,"This video describes the concepts of epidemiology, etiology, and risk factors. Epidemiology includes studying the risk factors, causes, progression, characteristics, and distribution of mental health disorders (or any disorder). Etiological factors are causal, although in the mental health treatment field, etiology can be difficult if not impossible to identify for many mental health disorders. If a factor is truly etiological to a specific mental health disorder, then removing that factor, in theory, would prevent the development of that mental health disorder. Risk factors are associated with the development of a mental health disorder, but are not necessarily etiological. All etiological factors are risk factors, but not all risk factors are etiological.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1981,What are the Etiological and Risk Factors for Borderline Personality Disorder?,2018-01-05,21355,672,23,"This video describes some of the etiological (causal) and risk factors associated with Borderline Personality Disorder. It is believed that Borderline Personality Disorder is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for Borderline Personality Disorder include brain structure, neurotransmitter levels, trauma, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, poor parenting, inconsistent parenting, exposure to hostility and conflict, and verbal abuse.
Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized by a number of potential symptoms including a fear of abandonment, a series of unstable relationships, self-identity changes, stress-related paranoia, risky and impulsive behavior, suicidal behavior or threats, mood swings, empty feelings, and anger. One of key features of Borderline Personality Disorder is the idealization/devaluation cycle, sometimes called the love/hate cycle. This two-stage cycle can sometimes lead to the abandonment that an individual with Borderline Personality Disorder fears. The name of Borderline Personality Disorder was given during a time when the diagnosis was thought to be on the border between neurosis and psychosis, so the name is no longer consistent with our current understanding of the disorder. Borderline Personality Disorder responds to treatment to some degree in many individuals. Potential treatments include Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Dialectic Behavior Therapy (DBT), and group therapy. Borderline Personality Disorder is thought of as occurring more in women than in men, but evidence suggests it affects men and women in equal numbers.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1982,What is Misattribution of Arousal?,2018-01-04,2506,50,5,"This video describes the construct of misattribution of arousal. This theory links attraction and arousal. Arousal is a heightened state of alertness. This This concept was first made popular by the publication of a study in 1974 by Dutton and Aron. This study used two bridges, one which was 450 feet long and 230 feet off the ground (experimental bridge). The other bridge was 10 feet off the ground (control bridge). The researchers used an attractive female experimenter to approached unaccompanied males between the ages of 18 and 35. She asked them to complete a survey and write a brief dramatic story about a neutral image. The female experimenter then wrote down her phone number and gave it to the participants and indicated that they could call her to ask more about the study. Of those who agreed to take the phone number on the experimental bridge, 9 of 18 called the female experimenter compared just 2 out of 16 on the control bridge.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1983,Is the 93% - 7% Rule of Nonverbal and Verbal Communication True?,2018-01-03,5599,147,3,"This video describes the interpretation of a research study about non-verbal and verbal communication. In the 1960s, a researcher named Albert Mehrabian studied non-verbal and verbal communication. His findings have been misinterpreted to suggest that 93% of communication is non-verbal and 7% is verbal. Mehrabian’s research actually demonstrated that if non-verbal and verbal communication do not match (incongruent), someone will likely pay more attention to the non-verbal message.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1984,What is Non Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Arousal Disorder?,2018-01-02,10716,194,8,"This video describes Non Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Arousal Disorder. This disorder can be divided into two subtypes: sleepwalking and sleep terrors. The sleepwalking subtype is an episode of incomplete arousal usually occurring in the first 1/3 of the night. This episode is characterized by walking around and engaging in simple, routine behavior. Typically, an individual is difficult to wake up during an episode. The sleepwalking episodes are not associated with dreaming and amnesia is observed afterward. The sleepwalking subtype has two specifiers: sleep-related eating behavior and sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia). Sleep related eating is more common in females. Sleep related sexual behavior is more common in males. The sleep terror subtype usually starts with a scream or cry from the perspective from an observer. Sleep terror subtype episodes are also referred to as night terrors.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1985,Can Violence be Predicted with the Macdonald Triad? (Homocidal Triad),2018-01-01,7901,248,23,"This video describes the Macdonald Triad. The Macdonald Triad is a theory developed in the 1960s that proposed a model for predicting violent behavior in adults by watching out for specific warning signs in childhood. The specific behaviors in childhood are bedwetting (after age 5), arson, and torturing small animals. Some later research supported the Macdonald Triad by indicating the factors predicted violent behavior in adults. Further research, however, found the factors had little association with violence. All three factors are associated with child abuse. Child abuse has an association with violent behavior as an adult, which supports the theory to a degree. The Macdonald Triad is largely not accepted because the factors do not have increased predictive value when they appear together, rather independently they are a cause for concern.",Jan,Dr. Todd Grande
1986,"What is the Theory of Needs (Achievement, Power, Affiliation)?",2017-12-31,19776,332,20,"This video describes the Theory of Needs. Under this theory, individuals are motivated to work by three psychological needs: achievement, power, and motivation. Individuals who are primarily motivated by achievement like moderate risk/reward tasks. They like to work with other individuals motivated by achievement. Individuals who are primarily motivated by power tend to seek leadership positions. There are two types of power: institutional (social) and personal. Generally, individuals who are primarily motivated by institutional power tend to be more successful than those motivated by personal power. Individuals who are primarily motivated by affiliation like low risk/reward tasks and like socializing. Most individuals are motivated by a combination of all three motivators.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1987,What is Severe and Persistent Mental Illness?,2017-12-30,10575,293,27,"This video describes Severe and Persistent Mental Illness (Serious Mental Illness). The definition of Severe and Persistent Mental Illness varies, however, generally for an individual to qualify for this category they would have to be 18 years or older, have at least one diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), and have severe limitations on functioning. Some DSM diagnoses are excluded from Severe and Persistent Mental Illness, including Substance Use Disorders, Developmental Disorders, Dementia, and Mental Health Disorder caused by a general medical condition. Schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder are overrepresented in Severe and Persistent Mental Illness. Severe and Persistent Mental Illness is a sub-category of Mental Illness. In a given year, 20 – 25% of Americans will experience a Mental Health Disorder. For Severe and Persistent Mental Illness, the percentage drops to about 4%. Severe and Persistent Mental Illness affects females (5%) more than males (4%). The life expectancy for any given individual in the United States is 77 years. The average life expectancy for those with Severe and Persistent Mental Illness is 52 years. Many individuals with a Severe and Persistent Mental Illness have a comorbid substance use disorder. Obesity, poor nutrition, trauma, and lack of access to healthcare disproportionately affect those with Severe and Persistent Mental Illness. Risk factors associated with higher mortality include disorganized thinking, reality testing, paranoia, impulsivity, and difficulty communicating.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1988,What is the Difference Between Acute Stress Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder?,2017-12-29,43325,942,32,"This video discusses the differences between Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Both disorders require a qualifying stressor (trauma) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This traumatic event must be directly experienced, witnessed, occur to a close friend or family member, or involve repeated exposure to aversive details of a trauma.
PTSD is characterized by the developing of specific symptoms after a qualifying stressor. The general symptom categories include intrusion, avoidance, negative mood, and arousal. Specific symptoms include recurrent memories, recurrent dreams, dissociative reactions, avoiding thoughts, avoiding feelings, avoiding memories, avoiding external reminders, negative beliefs, memory difficulties, negative emotions, cognitive distortions, hypervigilance, self-destructive behavior, sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, recklessness, and anger outbursts. The criteria must be met for at least one month. ASD has a similar set of symptom criteria, however, the symptoms must be present for at least three days but no more than one month. After a traumatic event, individuals who are assessed for ASD may go on to develop PTSD. About 80% of individuals who are diagnosed with the full criteria of ASD will develop PTSD. About 60% of individuals who have subclinical ASD will develop PTSD. About 4% of individuals who do not qualify for ASD will develop PTSD.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande

Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with unlimited success, feeling too special to be understood by regular people, needing excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, being interpersonally exploitative, having a lack of empathy, being envious and others and believe others are envious of them, and being arrogant. Oftentimes an individual with Narcissistic Personality Disorder wants to be recognized as superior, believes they are so complex and amazing that they can only be understood by special people, has low self-esteem, devalues the contributions of others, and is condescending. Criticism is not well received by most people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Comorbid disorders include other personality disorders (e.g. Antisocial Personality Disorder), Anorexia Nervosa, and substance use disorders (especially cocaine use disorder). The prevalence of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is about 1%. Common goals in mental health treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorder include adjusting behavior to improve relationships, developing skills resolve employment and career issues, and increasing insight.

1990,What is Anosognosia?,2017-12-27,15019,381,11,This video describes the concept of anosognosia. Anosognosia is a lack of insight or awareness about having a disorder and is a strong predictor of poor treatment outcomes. Anosognosia often occurs with Schizophrenia and occurs about 40% of the time with Bipolar Disorder. Anosognosia is different than denial. Anosognosia is thought to be neurologically-based. Denial is a psychological mechanism often observed with substance use disorders.,Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1991,Do Subliminal Messages Affect Human Behavior?,2017-12-26,108518,2097,34,"This video discusses the concept of subliminal messages. Subliminal messaging is based on psychodynamic theory, specifically the role of the conscious, subconscious, and unconscious mind. Subliminal messages are below the Absolute Threshold Level for the conscious mind. Supraliminal messages are above the Absolute Threshold Level for the conscious mind and are often confused subliminal messages. Subliminal messages may have a small effect on human behavior, but not as pronounced as supraliminal messages.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1992,Bias in Research,2017-12-24,9496,142,14,"This video discusses the concept of bias in research. Bias is evident when researching an issue that is polarizing or when financial gain is at stake. Even without these elements, bias exists in research because of other factors including researchers wanting a particular result to occur. Bias can be limited by independent verification of results, attentive and critical reading of multiple articles on the same topic, and stringent research design.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1993,Does Controlled Aggression in Therapy Reduce Anger?,2017-12-23,1432,41,8,"This video discusses the concept of controlled release of aggression as a therapeutic technique. Controlled aggression is a technique used in a few mental health therapies including gestalt therapy. Oftentimes it involves hitting pillows or some other inanimate object. The evidence suggests that the metaphor of “letting of steam” does not apply to mental health treatment. Engaging in aggressive behavior, even controlled aggression techniques, appears to increase the risk of aggression.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1994,What is Schizotypal Personality Disorder?,2017-12-22,91037,2744,137,"This video describes Schizotypal Personality Disorder. Schizotypal Personality Disorder is in Cluster A in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). This is the same cluster as Paranoid Personality Disorder and Schizoid Personality Disorder. Schizotypal Personality Disorder is characterized by ideas of reference, odd beliefs, unusual perceptions, odd thinking or speech (e.g. elaborate, metaphorical, vague), paranoid ideation, inappropriate and constricted affect, peculiar behavioral appearance, lacking close friends, and social anxiety. Both disorders are characterized by lack of close friends and unusual affect. The ideas of reference criterion lacks delusional conviction. The odd speech criterion does not rise to the level of incoherence. Schizotypal Personality Disorder affects males more often than females. The prevalence of Schizotypal Personality Disorder is about 4%. Schizotypal Personality Disorder is comorbid with Major Depressive Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande
1995,What is the difference between Antisocial Personality Disorder & Narcissistic Personality Disorder?,2017-12-21,61996,1396,34,"This video describes the differences between Antisocial Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. These disorders have a few features in common including dismissiveness, being strong-willed, and lack of empathy. Symptoms associated with Antisocial Personality Disorder but not with Narcissistic Personality Disorder include impulsivity and aggression. Symptoms associated with Narcissistic Personality Disorder but not with Antisocial Personality Disorder include the relationship with Conduct Disorder, the type of criminality, and the need for excessive admiration.
Antisocial Personality Disorder is characterized by repeated acts that violate the norms of society, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, verbal and physical aggression, reckless disregard for the safety of others, irresponsibility, lack of remorse, and lack of empathy. The characteristics typically associated with Antisocial Personality Disorder in prison settings are superficial charm, lack of empathy, inflated self-appraisal. The etiology of Antisocial Personality Disorder is genetic and environmental. Trauma appears to contributed to the development of Antisocial Personality Disorder. The prevalence of Antisocial Personality Disorder is about 3% of males and 1% of females. About 70% - 80% of males in prison may have Antisocial Personality Disorder. Sociopathy and psychopathy are sets of characteristics that represent distinct patterns of behavior and etiology, but are still under the Antisocial Personality Disorder classification. Generally, a person suffering from sociopathy is thought to have developed the disorder as a result of a stressor, such as trauma. Genetics are thought to be responsible for psychopathy. Both are associated with criminal activity, however, sociopathy is associated with impulsive criminal acts whereas psychopathy is associated with planned crimes. Meaningful relationships are difficult to form with psychopathy, but slightly easier to form with sociopathy. Sociopathy is associated with mood dysphoria and dysregulation, whereas psychopathy is associated with remaining more emotionally stable. Psychopathy is associated with being cold and calculating, and considering the consequences of behavior more carefully than in sociopathy.
Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a preoccupation with unlimited success, feeling too special to be understood by regular people, needing excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, being interpersonally exploitative, having a lack of empathy, being envious and others and believe others are envious of them, and being arrogant.

1997,What are the Symptoms of Schizophrenia?,2017-12-19,26265,850,28,"This video describes the symptoms associated with Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is sometimes conceptualized as having three phases: active phase (acute phase), prodromal phase, and residual phase. The active phase of Schizophrenia is characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms include avolition, which is a reduction in goal-directed behavior. The prodromal and residual phases are characterized by ideas of reference, unusual perceptions, vague speech, and negative symptoms. All the phases of Schizophrenia are associated with dysphoric mood, inappropriate affect, decreased interest in food and eating, sleep disturbance, and cognitive deficits. Hostility and aggression are sometimes associated with Schizophrenia, but the majority of individuals with Schizophrenia are not hostile or aggressive. Random assaults are not common. Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior. Anosognosia often occurs with Schizophrenia. Anosognosia is a lack of insight or awareness about having a disorder and is a strong predictor of poor treatment outcomes. Schizophrenia is typically treated with medication and psychotherapy.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande

2002,What is the Actual Probability that a Marriage Will End in Divorce?,2017-12-15,24967,644,68,"This video discusses the topic of the divorce rate and the probability that a marriage will end in divorce. For a number of years, research indicated that about 50% of all marriages would end in divorce. That statistic has been challenged recently. Some say the statistic is closer to 40% or 45%. There is evidence to support both theories, however, there is no strong evidence to suggest the 50% is no longer true. First, second, and third marriages have different probabilities of divorce (42%, 60%, & 73% respectively).

Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or Bipolar Disorder cannot be diagnosed at the same time as Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Substance Use Disorder, and Conduct Disorder are comorbid with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder so an individual can have these disorder and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder at the same time. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder can be thought of as a more severe version of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), in part, due to the high number of children being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder is classified as a depressive disorder in the DSM.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande

2014,Do Lie Detectors (Polygraphs) Really Work?,2017-12-03,10044,362,27,"This video reviews the evidence supporting and refuting the accuracy of polygraphs (lie detector test). The use of polygraphs for any application is controversial. Polygraphs measure heart rate, respiration, and skin conductivity, under the theory that changes in these areas occur when someone is lying. Current research does not support the idea that polygraphs work. There is no physiological reaction associated with deception, so the underlying theory of the polygraph is not supported. Measures of the physiological responses may be accurate, but there is no pattern of responses that indicate deception. Countermeasures have also been developed, which appear to make the polygraph results even less valid. Physical movement, cognitive training, and certain medications have all been identified as countermeasures to a polygraph. True positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates for polygraphs have been studied. The false positive accuracy is about 50%. The accuracy is slightly higher for true positives. The concept of detecting lies would have many potential applications, however, the polygraph is not scientifically supported. Studies show that two-thirds of the public believe polygraphs are fairly reliable and valid. More research on the issue of polygraphs and their usage is needed.",Dec,Dr. Todd Grande

Somatic Symptom Disorder is characterized by excessive worry about medical conditions and involves physical symptoms such as pain or fatigue. Illness Anxiety Disorder is similar, however, there are no physical symptoms or minor physical symptoms. Both disorders are characterized by a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious medical condition, anxiety, and excessive checking for symptoms.",Nov,Dr. Todd Grande
2038,Is the Eye Movement Element of EMDR Effective?,2017-11-04,15168,447,31,"This video describes the controversy surrounding Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR has been shown to be effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), however, the element of the therapy that appears to be effective is imaginal exposure, which is an established element in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). The eye movement element of EMDR does not appear to add effectiveness to EMDR above the effectiveness measured by imaginal exposure. Also, the use of EMDR has expanded beyond only PTSD, although there is a lack of clear evidence EMDR is effective for other mental health disorders.",Nov,Dr. Todd Grande
2039,What is the difference between Introversion and Extroversion?,2017-11-02,17941,664,33,"This video describes the difference between introversion (intraversion) and extroversion (extraversion). Introversion and Extroversion are both personality traits. Introverts tend to gain energy from being alone, thinking, and self-reflecting. Extroverts tend to feel refreshed by engaging in social interactions. Some introverts do not like a lot of stimulation such as bright lights and loud sounds. Extroverts tend to seek out stimulation and do not mind crowded venues. Introverts tend to have a few close friendships, whereas extroverts tend to have many acquaintances. Both introverts and extroverts can take on the characteristics of the opposite trait, but it is sometimes difficult to do, particularly for those who are pure introverts and pure extroverts. Carl Jung coined the terms introversion and extroversion as part of analytic theory.",Nov,Dr. Todd Grande
2040,Process Addiction vs. Substance Use Disorder,2017-11-01,15428,434,9,"This video describes the term “process addiction.” A process addiction (behavioral addiction) is when an individual demonstrates behavior consistent with addiction without a substance being involved. Common process addictions include shopping, gambling, Internet, and eating addictions. A process addiction can have similar effects on the brain as substances such as alcohol, heroin, cocaine, nicotine, and other drugs. The treatment for process addictions is sometimes similar to the treatment for substance use disorders.

2041,Positive and Negative Reinforcement and Punishment,2017-10-30,7330,146,5,This video describes the concepts of positive and negative reinforcement and positive and negative punishment. Reinforcement is adding something desirable or removing something undesirable in an effort to increase the probability of a target behavior. Punishment is adding something undesirable or removing something desirable in an effort to decrease the probability of a target behavior. The terms positive and negative refer to the adding or removing function in reinforcement and punishment. Positive refers to adding something and negative refers to removing something. Reinforcement and punishment are used to modify behavior. Research indicates that reinforcement is more effective than punishment in most instances. Reinforcement and punishment are sometimes used in certain behavior and cognitive behavior modalities.,Oct,Dr. Todd Grande
2042,Mechanisms of Anger and Outbursts of Anger,2017-10-28,9207,387,17,"This video describes the mechanisms for anger and anger outbursts. Sometimes acting on anger is incorrectly thought of as similar to a reflex, however, there are intermediate cognitive functions and emotions between a stimulus and acting out on feelings of anger. Counselors can use this principle as an opportunity to prevent anger outbursts in clients who report anger management difficulties. Among possible techniques for controlling outbursts, counselors can help clients to intervene between the stimulus and the emotion of anger and between the anger and the outburst of anger.",Oct,Dr. Todd Grande

2045,What is the Disease Model of Addiction?,2017-10-23,15894,289,16,"This video describes the disease model of addiction. The disease model of addiction states that changes in the brain due to substance use greatly compromise an individual’s ability to stop using drugs or alcohol. This model treats substance use disorders more like a medical condition as opposed to a “decision to stop using.” Some other models of addiction more heavily weight the role of accountability, responsibility, and motivation in the recovery from substance use disorders. Many of the models offer something of value to the discussion of addiction treatment, however, it is my opinion that the disease model is currently the most useful model of addiction available.",Oct,Dr. Todd Grande

The Bonferroni correction is a conservative post hoc test (controls Type I Error rate) and increase the probability of a Type II error too much for some applications. The Holm method is an alternative to the Bonferroni correction. The Holm method increases the Type I error probability and decreases the Type II error probability. In this example, three groups are compared using a one-way AVOVA using the Data Analysis tools in Excel. In these tools, the one-way ANOVA is referred to as “ANOVA: Single Factor.” The results of this ANOVA are interpreted. The formulas to adjust the alpha levels for both the Bonferroni correction and the Holm method are demonstrated. An independent t test is performed for each pairwise comparison. For both methods, the alpha is adjusted from the level used for the ANOVA (in this example it is .05) based on the number of levels, and in the case of the Holm method, the rank of each significance level. The probability value (p value) from each t test is compared to the adjusted alpha values. If the p value is less than the alpha value, the null hypothesis is rejected, and it is assumed there is a difference between the groups. If the p value is greater than the alpha value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and no difference between the groups is assumed.",Aug,Dr. Todd Grande
