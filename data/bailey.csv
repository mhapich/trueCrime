Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Today we are diving in to a topic personal to me - my mom was a 911 dispatcher when I was growing up. And this experience always made me wonder… what happened before 911 existed? I did some digging, and it turns it involves the Titanic sinking, a woman named Kitty in Queens, and the modern-day Karen.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. When you think of the zoo, what comes to mind? Saying hi to cute animals?

Welcome to the Dark History podcast, the show where we talk about that hot history goss. And today we’re talking about a new kind of gossip: the kind that could both save and ruin lives, should you blow the whistle. That’s right, today’s episode is on whistleblowers—people that saw something and said something, despite the risk to themselves. Because those in power don’t like it when you pull down their ivory tower. It’s a dirty job, but someone’s gotta do it.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Remember that movie, The Purge? The one where for one day only you could commit whatever crime you wanted. Yeah,  back when it came out in 2013, everyone was losing their minds. They were so worried that people would just randomly start murdering each other. Well, what if I told you there was already a real-life Purge that had happened in America over a hundred years ago? Well, Buckle Up Baby. In today’s episode, we’re talking about the Red Summer of 1919. A time in history when riots broke out in 26 different cities across the country and the cops were just letting people murder.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. We’ve talked about William Hearst on here before. He is one of the OG Nepo Babies.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. How old do you think plastic surgery is? I thought it started like 50/60 years ago. But then someone told me it started because of soldiers injured in WWI, GASP. But then someone else said that forms of plastic surgery had been around since before Jesus. I. Was. Shooketh. I needed to know more. So I started digging, and oooo baby. In today’s episode, we get into the history of Plastic Surgery. How it started, why it started, and when it started. And what does a dog with fake boobs have to do with it??

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Okay, so we can’t talk about SATs and college admission without mentioning Aunt Becky, remember that whole thing? But Aunt Becky wasn’t the first person ever to use money to help her kid get into college. Far from it. And there is one element of college admissions where there is a lot of money floating around, too much money. I mean we’re talking billion-dollar industry money. It's the SATs baby. In today’s episode, we look into the history of the SATs, how it started, why we have it, why there’s so much money in it, and try to figure out who the f is even on The College Board. Who is it???

18,The Power of Hate- Death to Disco | Dark History with Bailey Sarian,2023-03-02,633125.0,20384,1294,"Hi friends, happy Thursday!

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Would you believe me if I told you that one grumpy radio DJ from Chicago changed the face of the music industry as we know it? And that he did this with exploding records and frisbees of death? Well, let me explain…because that is all true. In today’s episode, we talk about Disco Demolition Night. And how it altered the path of not only Disco Music but all pop music as we know it today. 

I appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.

19,That $7 Shirt Is Making You Sick: Fast Fashion vs. the World | Dark History with Bailey Sarian,2023-02-23,988001.0,31845,2201,"Hi friends, happy Thursday!

Welcome to the Dark History podcast.  I feel like there is a new trend every two days. And I do not know how to keep up. And by the time I figure it out, I’m already like four trends behind. But I just don’t know how people are buying these trends so quickly. How are people staying on top of all these new clothes we need every week? And turns out the answer is a little thing known as “fast fashion”. In today’s episode, we get into fast fashion. It’s been around for longer than you think and its impact and damage are even more than you think. Sorry babe, but you’re gonna take a real hard look at your closet after this one.

I appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.

Hi friends, happy Monday! 
There’s no other way to put it, Melvin Rees Jr was a monster.  He committed some horrible crimes and he got away with it for far too long based on how much evidence they had. I mean, how did he get away with it? I think that might be a little easy, how does one solve mysteries with not so great police in charge? seems to happen a lot.
Also, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, you make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon. 
My next MMM upload will be 2-6 hope to see you there.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. What do you think of when you think of “Luxury Fashion” ? Glitz, glamor, status?…Nazis, perhaps?? Plot twist I know. In today’s episode we talk about a few luxury fashion brands that have some pretty shady histories of racism, sexual assault, secret love children, and Nazis. It’ll really make you think before you buy or not. Either way, I fully support horizontal collaborations. 

I appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast.  New Years. Honestly, not my favorite of the holidays. It’s cold. Sequin Dresses are super uncomfortable. Everyone’s Drunk. And a midnight kiss is overrated.  So I wanted to prove that New Years sucks because it has a dark and dirty past. And I was right. But once I read the story, I wasn’t very happy to be right. Because let me tell you, this one is messed up. In today’s story we get into the very dark story of Heartbreak/Hiring Day.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Is there anything as cozy as a Christmas tree? When you look at it, what do you think of? Family, holidays, presents, hot coco, singing carols, good times etc etc. But have you ever looked at a Christmas tree and thought about chopped off d**k? Because it turns out you should. In today’s episode we get into the dark history of four of our favorite holiday traditions: Christmas Trees, Gingerbread, Christmas Cards, and Krampus. And trust me when I tell you, some of this info really jingled my bells.

42,Death By Christmas Candle: What’s Really in Your Favorite Products? | Dark History - Bailey Sarian,2022-12-15,846305.0,31045,2646,"Hi Friends! Happy Thursday! 

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Tis the season. And by season I mean scented candle season. Nothing makes you feel more warm and cuddly than an apple cinnamon candle and a blanket. But what if I told you by burning that candle you’re doing the same amount of damage as just inhaling straight exhaust fumes. Seriously. In today’s episode we go into the dark seedy history of fragrance. And how because of them, something as simple as a scented candle is deadly.

I appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.

Hi friends, happy Monday! 

I am really interested in hearing what you all have to say about this week's episode. The twins obviously shouldn’t have done that to their mom, but…it’s not like they were in the best situation. Is this really a crime of passion…or just teenage rebellion that went too far?

Also, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week and I'll be seeing you very soon

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. There’s nothing I love more than dropping a good ole F-bomb. But who was the original person to drop it? Was there a caveman somewhere that stubbed his toe and yelled it out? Or was it yelled on a medieval battlefield? Well I had to find out. In today’s episode we look into the history of swearing and focus on three of the big ones.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. I love a good cake. And with cake mixes right from the store, you don’t need a baking degree or whatever. Now if only I could actually get the cake in the oven before eating all that damn good cake batter. Maybe one day. But while you lick your spoon, let me tell you about America’s homemaker, Mrs. Betty Crocker. In today’s episode, we’ll learn all about her life and what influenced her to become a baker. You might want to set your timer, because the amount of FRAUD in this episode will overbake anyone’s cake! I don’t know, I tried. Just watch.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. What scares parents more than anything else? It’s the Devil, of course. And it wasn’t too long ago where this fear turned into a nationwide craze. In today’s episode we’ll talk about how Satan invaded our board games, music, even our classrooms! And if you think that everyone just sat down, calmly talked it over like adults, and everything was fine…oh buddy you’d be wrong.  It was a total dumpster fire, from hell!

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. It’s spooky season babbyyy. Ghosts, goblins, ghouls, and witches. Oooo witches. It’s hard to have a spooky season without witches. But many people hundreds of years ago tried real hard to get rid of all the witches. In today’s episode we’re going to talk about Witch Hunts, but not the ones in Salem. The Witch Hunts we are talking about make those ones look like childsplay. We’re going back to the original hunts that spread across the world.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. The Bermuda Triangle, the most mysterious shape on the entire planet. Seriously, why has no one been able to figure out what’s going on there?? It’s no mystery that every year multiple ships and planes are lost to the triangle, and it’s been that way for centuries. So how come no one is able to figure out what the heck is going on?? In today’s episode, we look into the mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle and talk about some potential theories about it. But Bermie isn’t the only mysterious water disappearance we’re talking about, Oh Nay Nay. We’ll also dive into ghosts ships and lost sunken cities.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast.  Did you know that fewer people know the recipe for Coca-Cola than know the nuclear code? Or that the few people who do know the recipe are not allowed to fly at the same time in case their flights go down. So how did Coca-Cola become such precious cargo? Well in today’s episode we get into Coke’s history, when did the cocaine get taken out and why, how it grew into the empire we know today, and what shady secrets they keep in their vault with the recipe. 

I appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. We’re going to the chapel and we’re going to get married! But it’s not all pretty dresses and delicious cake (mmmmmm cake). In fact, a lot of the wedding traditions that we hold near and dear have a pretty dark past. In today’s episode we’ll find out why we kiss the bride, why the father gives the bride away, why bridesmaids exist and what’s with their matching dresses, and why the garter toss is even a thing.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. What’s the craziest thing you’ve mailed? I feel like I remember a time in grade school where everyone was mailing potatoes.  Anyone else? No? Just Me? Cool. Anyways, what I’m saying is throughout history, people have sent some crazy things in the mail. And sometimes, the things they sent were…dangerous. On today’s episode we’re talking all about the history of the Post Office. All the twists and turns. And how people got away with mailing….babies.

66,She’s in OUR DNA?! Who is Henrietta Lacks?,2022-08-25,1450017.0,42959,2750,"Hi friends, happy Thursday!

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. One of my favorite things about this podcast is learning about all kinds of people I had no idea even existed. And today’s story is exactly one of those. In this week’s episode we are going to discuss the story of Henrietta Lacks. Who’s that you ask? Well she is the woman who changed the face of medicine and has saved millions of lives. She’s also the woman whose DNA is inside you right now. But if she’s done all that, why doesn’t anyone know who she is. Well my dear, that’s because her identity was kept a secret for decades while others gathered acclaim and riches off of her cells. DRAMA.

On today’s episode we get into the story about what was happening behind the glitter and rainbows at Lisa Frank Inc.

68,Where did Sex toys even come from? Sinful or medicinal? Dark History,2022-08-11,1485993.0,57257,2876,"Hi friends, happy Thursday!

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Sex has been a part of humanity since the dawn of time. Do you know what else has been around for a while? Sex Toys. Oh yeah. There’s proof of dildos as far back as 30,000 BCE. But how did it go from phallic rocks to the multi-million dollar sex toy industry we have today. On today’s episode we go into the surprising and complicated history of the dildo. We’ll figure out what’s true, what’s a lie, and how the dildo is still around even after many attempts to ruin it.

Welcome to Dark History.  People used to be sacrificed for popcorn. Yep. The buttery goodness that you finish eating before the trailers are even over at the movies. Now you may be thinking, “how in the heck does that make any sense?” Because, honestly, that was also my initial reaction. But let me tell you, the history of popcorn is WILD. And we’re getting into all of it on today’s episode. So buckle in, babe.

I appreciate you for coming by, and I hope to be seeing you next week for even more dark history. Hope you have a great week ahead and I will be seeing you very soon xx Bailey Sarian

Welcome to the Dark History podcast! I honestly had no idea what to expect when we started this Dark History journey a year ago, and it turned out to be so much more than I expected. We got to share some really crazy stories. Some good, some awful, some that sound like a soap opera, and some that I still can’t believe are true. Today we’re going to do something a little different and honor the best and the worst of season one. With Dark History presents: The Joanie Awards.

77,Heroin & Cigarettes & Tapeworms: The Dark History of Diet Culture,2022-05-05,2576281.0,82941,6833,"Hi friends, happy Thursday!

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Buckle in, babe, because we’re going to talk about the devastating world of DIET CULTURE. When I started researching this episode, all I wanted to know is who came up with the idea of a diet. But then I discovered that somewhere along the way, dieting became less about health and more about -surprise surprise- money and treating women horribly. So today, we’re headed everywhere from ancient Greece to Jane Fonda’s workout studio to figure out the Dark History of Diet Culture.

Welcome to the Dark History podcast. Sallie Mae, just saying the name sends shivers down your spine. Why is that? Probably because she’s related to nearly $1.75 TRILLION worth of debt. All for the same thing: Student Loans. Today we get into the history of student loans. How did they start? How did they evolve to what we know today? And what did SallieMae do to make us all hate her?

In 1972, an article went viral before the internet existed. The headline read: “Syphilis Victims in U.S. Study Went Untreated for 40 Years.” This bombshell report exposed the Tuskegee Experiment for what it was: a crime against humanity. Today, Bailey tells the story of the study’s 400 participants and the monsters who lied and took advantage of them even though a cure to their illness was readily available.

123,Ep #11: Thomas Edison maybe killed a guy and other enlightening Edison tales | Dark History Podcast,2021-09-16,1859020.0,53250,4022,"Hi friends, happy Thursday!

When people think of American innovation, one name always comes up: Thomas Edison. But, just like everything else in our series, there’s a dark side to Tommy boy. Today, Bailey reveals a story that shines Edison in a different light, a more unflattering one filled with buried tales of greed, fame, dishonesty and, dare she say, murder. 

I appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more dark history.

Modern medicine had to start somewhere, right? And where it started ain’t too pretty. In order to study the inside of the body, bodies had to be dissected. And where did medical students and doctors get bodies to dissect in 1788? They stole ‘em from the cemetery, silly. Today, Bailey tells the wild story of the 1788 Doctors’ Riots.

Since starting my Monday series, I would always come across strange and unusual stories throughout history that would blow my mind! I would ask myself, ""why in the world did we not learn this in school?"" or maybe we did, and I'm just an idiot. Either way, I wanted to sit down and have a chat about all the strange stories throughout history that isn't talked about much. Oh babe, this is murder mystery and makeup to the 10th degree! 

You can find Dark History podcast wherever you listen to podcasts Wednesday, June 2nd and watch the visual Dark History podcast here on YouTube on Thursdays! I hope you guys like it as much as I do, and I look forward to sharing some more dark stories throughout the week. woo. I love and appreciate you guys so much, and I hope to be seeing you very soon! x o Bailey Sarian

Hi friends happy Monday!
Hope you had a great Easter holiday and if you don't celebrate Easter hope you had a good week. Today I wanted to talk about an unsolved case that has been heavy on thy noggin. It's just a little too weird if you ask me. I smell a cover-up, but that's just my opinion and I would love to hear yours.

Hi friends happy Monday!
Hope you are having a wonderful day so far. Today I wanted to talk about the story of Bloody Mary. I was originally going to do this one for Halloween but then I realized it wasn’t even spooky lol! But over all, an interesting story. I personally love history and have been sprinkling in random little history stories throughout, I think it needs its own segment but don’t worry next week we will have a true crime story too. Anywho, thank you for all your constant love and support, it really means more than you know. I love and appreciate you so much and hope to be seeing you very soon!!! Lets make it a good week ahead

Hi friends happy Monday!
First of all thank you so much for being here, subscribing, hanging out, liking, disliking, just being here means a ton and I hope you know that!! Thank you for the 3 million subscribers!! Ahhhh. I can't say thank you enough
Today I wanted to talk about the case I am always asked to do the most, the unsolved mystery of Elizabeth Short, also known as the Black Dahlia. The story is just so sad and it's a bummer this one may never be fully solved. There are so many theories and things I left out just to give a more simplified version but overall I would love to hear your theories and input! 
Hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your week and I hope to be seeing you very soon!! Stay tuned next week for a giveaway!

I wanted to do one last Halloween edition, spooky story before we end the halloween fun. This video literally turned into me telling a story and no makeup, lol sorry!! Behind the scenes it was such a struggle, the glitter was EVERYWHERE because I spilled it and yeah, it was rough and I was over it. 

Dont forget to VOTE BABY!! Its your right. Find your local polling place here : https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/

Also, I will be skipping next Mondays upload for those of you who read the description box, I appreciate you haha. I have been skipping 1 Monday a month for my own mental well being and I feel like after this election and everything, maybe next Monday will be a good one to skip. But besides that, I’ll be back the following Monday with some True Crime stories again. woot. I also need to reset my background but, I cant figure out what I wanna do hmm. Wow I am really rambling in here.

 Anywho, I love and appreciate you guys so much. Please wear a mask and please vote. Thank you for hanging out with me and I hope to be seeing you very soon.  MAKE GOOD CHOICES I SAID.

Hi friends happy Monday!
 Hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there. Today I wanted to talk about Cindy James and the very suspish story around her case. 
I wanna say a big thank you for subscribing and hanging out with me, it really means more than you know and I really never imagined it would turn in to 2 million subscribers. INSANE. Now what?! I have no idea. BUT I do hope you have a good day and make good choices! I'll be seeing you very soon.

Hi Friends happy Saturday!
Hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there. 
Today I wanted to sit down and cry apparently lol. I really hope you guys do know how much I appreciate you and the support you guys have constantly shown me. 
I know this palette may seem very random and I understand for sure. A year ago when I was asked to do this, my channel was just starting to really grow because of my MMM videos and I couldn’t have even imagined it would turn into what it is today! Seriously. It's mind-blowing. The palette is for IPSY Glam Bag Plus so I needed to take into consideration who the IPSY subscriber is and I tried to create something that hopefully everyone would like, even if they had no idea who I was or watched my videos. If any of that makes sense. Wow my grammar is horrid. If you're reading this hi. Hopefully, that answers any questions/confusion. It was a very cool experience to see how collaborating on a palette works and I am forever grateful for the opportunity. 
I hope you have a great weekend ahead and hey, if you need to cry it out, LET YOURSELF CRY IT OUT OKAY?  Its been one helluva year 2020, that’s for sure. 
Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day ahead!! I’ll be seeing you next week x o

Hi friends happy Monday!
 Hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there. Sorry I went a little MIA but I am happy to be back. Today I wanted to talk about Jim Jones and what was going on with his whole situation. This could easily be a 3 part series, there are so many more people and factors that came into play as well, but I wanted to keep it simple and focus on Jim and his life. Honestly, it would've gotten so confusing QUICK if I started throwing all these different names at you. Anywho, thank you guys so much for stopping by and hanging out with me. Hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day, Love and appreciate you guys so much!! I hope to be seeing you very soon

Hi friends happy Monday!
 Hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there. Today I wanted to talk about Gerald Stano, what a weird story! Its hard to find out what happened to Paul afterwards some reports I cam across said that he was still working as Chief of Police in different areas, which is just terrifying to think of. All in all I think PAUL was the scary one in todays story. What are your thoughts?
Hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day, Love and appreciate you guys so much!! I hope to be seeing you very soon

Hi friends happy Monday!
 Hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there. Today I wanted to talk about Heavens Gate, ooohhhweee. This one is always highly requested! Now to be fair, I keep my videos pretty, simple? Basic? Straight to the point, so I do often leave out small details that I feel dont contribute to the overall story. What I am getting at is, you can always deep dive on your own and read more about these stories. At least you have an overall basic understanding of what it was. Hope that makes sense? Idk I always see comments about me leaving stuff out, so, just wanted to let you know? haha. 
Anyways, Hope you enjoy todays video, let me tell you I was so annoyed that I didnt notice the damn smeared lipstick until editing. boo. 
Hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day, Love and appreciate you guys so much!! I hope to be seeing you very soon

I always have mixed feelings about these types of stories, but i am also a chicken and get spooked easily by these types of stories. haha. I'm too scared to know the truth.  
 Let me know your thoughts down below and who you want me to talk about next week! I do read my comments and look forward to seeing what you guys have to say. I love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon.

 Sorry this one seems to be a bit short, I thought it was going to be wayyy longer. Also, if I seemed a little sassy, I have cramps and I guess I am sassy when I have cramps? ANYWHO. This story is so strange. I mean, Terrie had signs that there was foul play, how come NOBODY in a town that small said anything that lead to an arrest? People were talking, a little too much. ALSO, I need to stop apologizing but sorry not many images to work with either. I couldnt get clarification if the photo I had of Tate was indeed him and I dont want to use a wrong image. We will have to use our imaginations today. 
 Thank you for hanging out, hope you have a wonderful rest of your day. Please stay safe out there! I love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon!

 Hope you guys are staying safe out there!! Today I wanted to lightly talk about Ted Bundy and his whole mess. This video could easily be two hours long with all the information that is out there, but I just wanted to keep it pretty straight forward and not get lost in all the extra stuff. 
 Thank you guys for all the love you send my way, it means more than you know and I cant say thank you enough. I hit 800k which is absolutely insane to me and if I think about it too much, it freaks me out because that’s a lot of eyeballs. ahaha. Anyway, thank you, it really means a lot and I cant say thank you enough. 
 Let me know your thoughts in the comment section and who I should talk about next week! Have a wonderful rest of your day and please please please be safe out there. Stay inside PLEASE

I am so sorry I disappeared on you like that, it wasn't the original plan. Thank you for all the love and support you guys have sent my way, it truly means more than you know. I loveee youuu guysss!! I just felt like I needed to get some things off my chest BECAUSEEEE I had lots of people in my DM's angry with me for traveling during these times. Which, I understand from the outside looking in it may seem pretty effed up, but, thats not how it was at all. I just worry too much and need to let it go when people are mad at me, lol. 
I hope YOU guys are doing okay and being safe. I will try and get some more videos out during the week, I have one coming Wednesday that will show you what products I got in London! Is that cool?

 Today I wanted to talk about Lori Vallow and her missing children Tylee and JJ Vallow. The story, if you’ve been following, is…intense. There are a lot of weird things going on to say the least. I wasnt sure how to approach this one without it being so confusing, so I brought in some visuals. Haha. Sorry there wasnt much makeup involved, it was just too difficult. So, I just wanted to talk about the timeline of all the events and what we know happened so far. Im sure more and more will come to light but at the end of the day I really hope the children are found. 
 Let me know your thoughts down below! Hope you have a wonderful day today, I love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon.

Hi friends happy Monday ! 
 We’ve got a long one! Thank you for always sending recommendations my way, I so greatly appreciate you guys for doing that. Some of the story I did cut out for time purposes, but over all we got the major stuff covered. Um, not much you can really say about him. You know what’s crazy though ? His upbringing seems so tame compared to lots of others we’ve talked about here and he was REALLY BAD. I wonder if there was more to his upbringing he didnt share or I missed.  Let me know your thoughts down below. Long videos or shorter? I definitely lost my voice on this one. Ha. Love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon.

Hi Friends Happy MONDAY! 
  Yay Mondays. Hope your week/weekend was fantastic. Todays story is low key really heavy and sad and ugh, just awful. I kept getting recommended this over and over again so finally I caved and decided to share the story about Sylvia Likens. I definitely think in the future I just need to stay away from stories like these, they mess with me way too much. Dont get me wrong all the stories are awful , but this one was just super awful. 
 Anywho, Love and appreciate you guys so much! Me and my cold sore need a vacation now. Hope to see you very soon

Hi Friends, Happy Saturday! 
   YAY A COLLAB WITH LOUD LACQUER!! I have been working with the Loud Lacquer team for quite some time now and I am so excited to share these 4 beautiful polishes. A big thank you to YOU guys for always being here for me and always showing your support. I cant say thank you enough, seriously. I love and appreciate you guys more than you know. 
 But other than that exciting news, WIG HAUL. I purchased a bunch of wigs from Annabelle’s wigs and decided to try them on. I thought they were SO CUTE but once I compared the photo to the actual thing I am thinking…. Whaaaat? None of the wigs actually look like the image online, haha. Oh well. Hopefully I can fix them. 
 Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and hope to be seeing you very soon.

 Yay November. Today I wanted to talk about Margie Velma Bullard Barfield. Whew weee, she sure did do some damage for a long time. I believe all the fires, were her. All the husbands/boyfriends, were her. The people she took “care of”, yeah, I think she was responsible for all the chaos that was happening around her. Sad that it took so long for anyone to catch on. Would love to hear your thoughts down below.
Love you so much and please be safe out there! Hope to be seeing you very soon

Hi Friends, Happy Saturday!
 Today I asked my friend and hair stylist Dani to come in, style my hair and show us how to use the Halo hair extensions. I have had this thing sitting in my drawers forever because I couldnt get the thing to look right. Now that I know, its SO EASY! No damage and blends perfectly. Make sure to check out Dani's instagram and if you are in the los angeles area and want colorful hair I would highly suggest you go and see her.

Hi Friends, Happy Monday!
 Ive gotten a good amount of people asking for me to do a paranormal story (ya ya yeahhh you can mock ppl for saying this but I seriously have been getting a lot..hahahah). I know I have talked about true crime most of the time here but I figured since its October I could throw one in for some spooky time. 
 Believer or non believer, life is too short. If you wanna believe in ghosts COOL. WHY NOT. If you think its a bunch of bull, COOL. WHY NOT. At the end of the day, who cares, live your life and lets make it good. Hope you are having a wonderful day so far and let me know what you think of this look down below. 
 Love and appreciate you guys SOOOO MUCH and I hope to be seeing you very soon.

Hi Friends, Happy Monday !
 Look technically, September is almost over and I decided to just start the halloween looks. Today I was trying to recreate an Elvira look but, ya know, they can’t all be winners. 
 But todays story is about The Candyman, an awful human being, who really sucked. ALSO, there is another guy who was also named The Candyman , I'm sure people will let me know about that dude, he was somethinnnn else! 
 Honestly, there wasn’t much background info on him nor many pictures of , much of anything. Let me know your thoughts down below, do you believe the death penalty was a little much or no? I guess in the end , it doesn’t really matter because he is outta here. 
RiP To poor Timothy, so young and taken for such selfish reasons. 
Hope you have a wonderful day today, you make good choices and I will be seeing you very soon.

Hi Friends, Happy Monday!
 Ive actually gotten a request to talk about Pazuzu and bunch of times within this last week, its nuts. But big thank you to Samy Aguilar for recommending this one. Honestly, Pazuzu was.. something ELSE, I really dont know what else to say about that. What can we learn here? Sometimes I just really dont know! 
What I do know is, I love and appreciate you guys sooooo much and please be safe out there. Thank you for all of your love and support you send my way. It means more than you know, seriously. 
 Also, working on some Halloween spookiness (im a one man show so, hopefully it goes according to plan) that will start next week! Hope you have a wonderful week ahead and I will be seeing you very sooooooon mwahahhahahahah (spooky/creepy laugh)

Hi Friends, Happy Saturday
Today I woke up and wanted to be Sophia Loren. lol. So I created a makeup look inspired by her classic, iconic, beautiful look mixed with a little bit of Sharon Tate. Of course my eyes wouldn’t stop watering and it kinda was a mess but hey, its just makeup, it washes off. Have some fun, try something new and play ! LIVE A LITTLE! 
Also, let me know if you want more dating stories because I have a ton, lol. Anywho, love and appreciate you guys SOOOO MUCH, so so sooo much. Thank you for all the love and support you constantly show, it really means more than you know. Hope to be seeing you very very soon. Who is excited for halloween? What kind of looks should we do?

 *EDIT
 The last photo I showed of Barbara was actually a woman named Ruth Ellis. I was saving her image for another story and mixed up the two. My fault and sorry for the confusion. 

Hi Friends, Happy Monday!
 Today I wanted to talk about lame ol Barbara and what an awful person she was. I mean, I feel bad for her because she seemed to have a rough life, but damn, did she really need to ruin everyone elses? RIP to poor Tony, yes he made some bad choices but he did not deserve the treatment he received from his family and most of all his own MOTHER. 

OH! Also in the beginning I mentioned how I dont like the “this was boring” comments. I hope how I explained it, came out right. Im not responding to “haters” I just feel like, it needed to be said because I think we are so desensitized to these stories, honestly. Not just because of me but because of everything we see every day, media, movies, etc. I understand a story can be “boring” but, I just wanted to put out a little reminder to step back and think about it before you comment it. You never know who is watching/reading/seeing it. I know people wont give a damn and still do it anyways, I mean this is the internet, cmon. So, I will make sure to just block people who disrespect. I just want this to be a safe space and while I have some kind of control, I will keep it that way.
 
 But I am always all ears to constructive criticism and hearing feedback stuff like that! I am always trying to be better. ANYWAYSSS.. love and appreciate you guys a ton and I hope to be seeing you very soon

Hi Friends, Happy Monday !
 Hope you are having a wonderful day today so far. Today I wanted to talk about Theodore Kaczynski and his very smart brain but awful things he did. 
 Now I said a couple of times that I agreed with him on some points, but I forgot to say, hey man, I don’t agree with all the things he said. I started to skim parts of it and now I’m worried there’s some awful nonsense in there that now sounds like me saying “YA I AGREE!” haha.. im just agreeing with his thoughts on technology taking over society, blah blah.. you get it , I hope. 
Love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon

Hi Friends, Happy Saturday!
 I knew I wanted some grungy look today but wasnt sure what that was going to look like. At first I was like meh, not sure, but I wore it around for the day and I really liked it oh yes. I hope you like it too! Plus, its really easy to achieve. I swear, I am such a mess when I do my makeup and just kind of go for it, lol, this is why sometimes I have a hard time filming tutorials because I just kinda start globbing stuff on with no rhyme or reason. Love and appreciate you guys so much !! Your constant kind words and love means more than you know, seriously. You are loved so much. Anyways, I am rambling per usual. Hope you have a wonderful day today and I will be seeing you very soon.

Hi Friends Happy Monday
 Hope you are having a wonderful day today! This week I wanted to talk about Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris. I cannot get my mouth to say Roy properly , so I said Norris, sorry about it but, that’s the only way I could continue on. 
 Please be safe out there, seriously. Love and appreciate you all for the constant kind words you send my way and I hope you are able to have a great week ahead.

Hi Friends Happy Saturday

I also wanted to play with some yellow eyeshadow and at first I wasn’t feeling it but, I LOVED how it came out! Hope you love it too. Thank you to those who came by last weekend and said hi to me in chicagoooo! It meant more than you know, really. Love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon.

Hi Friends Happy Monday !
 Hope you are having a wonderful day so far. Today I wanted to talk about Sante and Kenny Kimes who were, busy, VERRRYYYY busy. Would love to hear your thoughts about Kenny and his sentencing. I also tried to set this up differently than my other videos, I am not sure if it was more confusing or more interesting, just let me know your thoughts down below! It was more confusing on my end to edit, that’s for sure. ALSO, I cut out SO MUCH more to this story but again, things were getting SO confusing with all these names being thrown around, I just decided to keep it straight to the point and not get too confusing. I mean, I tried. I am also on an airplane right now and there is turbulence and I am scared. Thank you for your time.  But other than that Please be safe out there, I love and appreciate you guys so much and I will be seeing you very soon!

 Hope you are having a wonderful day so far. Today I wanted to talk about Jose Luis Calva Zepeda and his whole… mess. There was a language barrier so, some things were a little unclear. Overall though, very sad story and I hope all of the families are at peace and have their closure. 
 I hope you have a wonderful day today, please be safe out there! Love and appreciate you all so so much.

Hi Friends Happy Saturday !
 Hope you are having a wonderful day so far. I knew today I wanted a good ol fashion smokey eye but I decided to bust out all my favorite drug store products to create the look. Please remember, you dont need to go out and buy everything I use in my tutorials, USE WHAT YOU HAVE (unless its super old and crusty then maybe not). I am going to try my best and stop buying, but, we will see how long that lasts.lol. Hope you like the look I created and its JUST MAKEUP. Lighten up, have some fun, it washes off. Do a smokey eye, why not?! Cmon now. 
 Anyways, I love and appreciate you all so much, I mean, I say that in all of my youtube description boxes but, its serious. I can’t say thank you enough for all the love and support you guys always show and I just wish I could give each and every one of you a big hug. I love you so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon. Hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.

_

Hi Friends Happy Monday !
 Sorry I missed last week. For those of you who understood and just let it go, THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU! There was no plan to skip last week, I just had a bad SD card and didnt have time to refilm/edit. I got a lot of push back for that and honestly, those people can scurry along. Crap happens man, there wasn’t anything I could do and it was out of my control. I wish I had a team of people helping me out with these but I dont, its just me and I am trying my best, really all I can say there. 
 ANYWAYS, todays story about the Richardson Family . A  very very sad story and I would love to hear your thoughts about it. 
 Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day and I will be seeing you very very soon 
xo

 Hope you are having a wonderful day so far. We've got a super long one today, we shall see how this one goes. I just have to say there was a lot more to this case, but I gave you a simple summary of it just because I know it can get a bit overwhelming. Unfortunately we will never really know how many people were victims and that is truly unfortunate.  I also didnt want to add in any photos of the living victims, I just felt like they were really trying to move forward with their lives and yeah. Will keep this in mind for future videos as well. I had to add some kind of humor throughout, it was really the only way to get through it, this one bugged me for dayzzzzz. so gross. 
 Please be safe out there!
I love you guys so much and appreciate all the love you send my way. I hope to be seeing you very soon , have a wonderful day and make some good choices !

Hi Friends ! Happy Saturday !
 This get ready situation took a total LEFT and everything seemed to go wrong lol. I just gave up on myself and started rambling about anything and everything. But I did answer a few questions and thought I would throw them out there for you to answer as well. Here are the questions, let me know your answers in the comment section below :

1. If you can instantly become an expert in something, what would it be? 

2. If you could eliminate one thing from your daily routine what would it be? 

3. What is the first thing you think of when you wake up in the morning?

4. You have to wear a T-shirt with one word on it for one year. Which word do you choose? 

5. What was the most embarrassing thing you did on a date? 

6. If you could commit any crime and get away with it, what would it be? 

7. F, MARRY Keeel 
Maury Povich
Brad Pitt but fight club brad pitt
Keanu Reeves 

Anywho, thanks for hanging out with me today. I hope you have a wonderful day , you make good choices and I will be seeing you very soon !

Hi Friends Happy Monday ! 
 A big thank you to you guys for subscribing, commenting, liking, disliking, whatever you do, I appreciate you SO MUCH! Words cannot express how happy I am that we have found some common interests here on youtube. Sharing our love for makeup and our INTEREST in true crime. I always say we like or enjoy, true crime but really what I mean is, were interested in it. I dont think anyone  ENJOYS these awful stories, at least I hope not. Im rambling. I haven’t slept yet, I pulled an all nighter editing this so sorry if there are lots of mistakes. ANYWAYS,  love you guys so much. 
 I wanted to talk about Mitrice Richardson, I feel like her story is pretty important. Her case got completely dismissed and not taken seriously, WHY?! WHY would they let her leave at 12:30 am without any car, phone, wallet, nothing?!?! Why was she arrested in the first place? Why why why why why. So many why’s and not enough answers here. There is also a LOT more to this story but I just couldn’t fit it in to one video, this one turned out way longer than expected. I will leave some links if you want to further learn about Mitrice’s story. 
 I hope for nothing but love, peace, closure and forgiveness for everyone involved. Mitrice was so young, so beautiful and had so much ahead of her. I pray for healing and love for the family. I also hope one day they can get some kind of closure. I know that doesnt mean much but , every family deserves closure. 
 Have a wonderful day today and I will be seeing you guys very soon. Love you

258,what REALLY happened in the Spreckels Mansion? Rebecca Zahau Case MurderMystery&Makeup|Bailey Sarian,2019-06-03,6321496.0,145407,6497,"Missing Footage / Further “Evidence"" : 
Evidence in the Guesthouse
Investigators noted a bottle of clear liquid, assumed to be water, present in the master bedroom of the guesthouse where Adam Shacknai stayed on the night of July 12th. The bottle was not tested for DNA evidence, drawing criticism from the Zahaus and their experts.Evidence technicians at the scene of Rebecca’s death found a pair of white, pink, and purple women’s underwear in a wastebasket in the guesthouse where Adam Shacknai was staying. The Zahaus and others critical of SDSO say that the underwear should have been tested for DNA and evidence of assault.
Fingerprints & DNA 
Forensic analyst Lisa DeMeo testified that she reviewed SDSO’s crime scene photos, fingerprints lifted from the scene, the autopsy report, and DNA analyses. She also looked at two knives that had been found in the mansion guest bedroom.
DeMeo testified that Adam’s fingerprints and DNA were not found on any of the surfaces tested by police investigators. There was also no Fingerprints found on the paint brushes, they had nothing found on them from either sides. It was believe that they were wiped down.The large Knife was tested and Rebeccas finger prints were found but only on the blade. It was in a weird spot as well, she tried to figure out how her fingers would’ve been on this blade and concluded it fit perfectly as if the blade was behind Rebeccas back, her fingers on the blade as if she was trying to cut through the rope. There were no prints on the handle of the knife. 
Smaller knife, her blood DNA was found on the knife but there was no fingerprints found on the blood. The blood was found on the entire bottom of the knife and caked up in the grooves. There was no blood found on Rebeccas hands or any source of blood on Rebecca except for her period/menstrual cycle. The knife had to be inserted or rubbed against her vaginal area. She was assaulted . The police had tested the knife but nobody did anything with that piece of evidence. 
Handwriting Evidence
The Zahaus’ legal team hired handwriting expert Michael Wakshull, who testified that he compared of several letters of the painted message with known handwriting samples/court documents of both Rebecca and Adam. The witness testified that based upon his examination, he believed that it was more likely that Adam had written the text than Rebecca. The biggest factor was the letter M. When Adam used the letter M the M was long, extended towards the end , it swooshed down. The M on the wall also swooshed down. The writing on the wall leaned to the left, Rebeccas writing leaned to the right and guess who’s writing leaned to the left, Adam . Also, he stated that when writing on a wall we are most likely to write at shoulder level, the writing if it was at shoulder level would come from someone who was 5’11 , Rebecca was 5’2 and Adam was 5’10 

Ugh sorry that happened! I was so bummed to see the MAIN CHUNK of evidence to further prove something happened to Rebecca was missing.Thank you for your patience with me and my small errors.

Hi Friends Happy Monday !

 Hope you are having a wonderful day today. Today I wanted to talk about Edmund Kemper III . Isn’t it kind of strange how most of these people we have been talking about have very similar names? Whats that all about? Anyways, the dude was a problem. Really, that’s what we can say about him.
 
Let me know your thoughts down below and who you want me to talk about next week. Please be safe out there, try and make some good choices! I love and appreciate you all so much and I will be seeing you very very soon.

Hi Friends, Happy Saturday ! This is a reupload of a video I posted in March. I took it down because it had gotten flagged for copyright (i guess the music wasnt approved) but i thought i would upload it today because I did NOT get to finish editing the video I wanted to post today ,boo. But, maybe i could sprinkle it in the week or save it for next saturday ? Let me know what you think, I am sure nobody is reading this and the comment section will be confused. haha.

Hi Friends Happy Saturday ! 
 Hope your week was well and your weekend is going well so far. Just wanted to upload a normal GRWM and talk about whatever was on my mind, lol, would you expect anything different? Also, I know nobody really reads the description box but if you are reading this, hi, I love you and appreciate you soooo much. Also, I apologize (I know I said I was going to stop with that) but I do apologize if this sounded like me complaining a lot, it was more me just explaining certain things. I read everyones comments, I see everything that comes in. The nice, the wonderful, the lovely and even all the bad. I want to upload more videos a week and I will do that because, I WANT TO, I love it ! I just tend to forget to balance life as well, that’s something Im working on. Haha. I mean I work too so its just hard to juggle sometimes, but I am figuring it out. Either way, I just really appreciate you guys for all the nice things you say, for the likes, subscribers, comments, I love you all! It all really means more than you know and I wish I could give you all a big hug. Anywho, have a good rest of your day and I will be seeing you very soon.

Hi Friends Happy MONDAY !
 Hope you are having a wonderful day today. This story is strange and so so so sad !!! It still remains unsolved. I personally feel like , all signs point to the guys in the house. We may never know what truly happened inside that townhouse but Katherine and Roberts family deserves closure and justice for what happened to Robert. 
 Let me know what you think and if you have any theories down below. Hope you have a wonderful day today , please be safe out there and I will be seeing you guys very very soon

Hi Friends Happy MONDAY !
 Hope you had a lovely holiday weekend or just normal weekend if the holiday does not apply. Today I wanted to talk about one of my FAVORITE conspiracy's which is the Denver International Airport. I would LOVE to hear your thoughts on this and if you think its all just a coincidence or what? 
I love conspiracy theories I think they are so fun but don't worry, I will keep doing True Crime talk, just thought I would throw this one in for fun.
it is called MurderMystery&Makeup so, it falls under Mystery..lol. 
Anywho, next week I will be back with a true crime story. Hope you have a wonderful day today and you make good choices

Hi Friends Happy MONDAY !
  Hope your day is off to a good start. Today I wanted to talk about Armin Meiwes and what the hell was going on over there, I mean he was trying to cook sausage and eat it, I mean, yep he did that. 
 Let me know what you think down below, did he REALLY deserve the sentencing he got if someone WILLINGLY participated ? Weird case right ? Least he’s vegan now, that’s good. 
 Hope you have a wonderful day today, make good choices and let me know who you want me to talk about next week ! Also stay tuned for a recap. 
 Love and appreciate you guys so much!! Please be safe out there.

HELLO Friends ! 
 Hope your Monday is off to a good start. I wanted to talk today about Rebecca Corium and her disappearance. The story is odd, you never get straight answers and ONCE AGAIN a big company just ignores and shuts down requests from the family to further investigate. 
 There are also many other reports of what was heard/seen but its hard to verify what is true or just rumors. There was also a flip flop found that Disney said belonged to Rebecca but was later proven to not be hers. I didn’t mention that part because, it was just another distraction set up by the company. 
 I hope Rebeccas family has found some sort of peace or can find their peace and closure, we all deserve that and its so confusing to me why this happens. 
 Love and appreciate you guys so much, I hope you have a good day and let me know who you want me to talk about next Monday. 
x o

HELLO Friends ! 
 Hope your Monday is off to a good start. I wanted to talk today about Lavena Johnson and how her family still fights for her. This case is so sad and I just want to give the family a big big hug. 
There is A LOT MORE to this case that I left out, I just tried my best to not make it too long, but please read more about the case within the links provided. Look all evidence points to this is a cover up so, what gives?
Thats really all I can say about that. Let me know your thoughts down below and I will be seeing you next Monday. Stay safe 

OH PS : Sorry I didn’t show product images on screen, honestly, not feeling well and just need to go to bed.

HELLO friends !
  Finally, a video on my skin care journey, Been working on this since 2017. Pretty simple, honestly. I failed to mention the main way I handle my stress is to meditate , which im not the best at , and then I see a therapist too, but most of all, just making sure I don't sweat the small stuff. Stress really caused some damage to my body and I really don't want to go through that again. Hope this video helps in some way. Sorry if the images of my micro needling face scares you, lol, but its what I looked liked, gorgeous. 
 We all have different skin, if you can, see a dermatologist who can guide you in the right direction. Stop wasting your money on products that aren't working for you and put that money towards seeing a DR. It'll save you a lot more in the long run. I appreciate you all so much for watching and subscribing , liking or disliking, it really means more than you know. Hope to be seeing you very very soon !!!!

HELLO HELLO HIIIII! 
   I have been consumed by the Chris Watts Case and so I thought I would sit down, get ready and talk some crime with you all. This is new to me, I don’t normally sit here and talk murder, so , if its a bit sloppy , I apologize . There are SO MANY layers to this case and unfortunately I Just couldn’t cover it all, so I just talk about what we do know.
 Let me know what you think down below and if some crime talk is something you would be interested in, in the future. I appreciate you so much for watching and I hope to be seeing you very soon

Hi friends ! 
   Happy Wednesday ! With Christmas just around the corner I thought I would try to find some unique gifts to get for that someone special. As always, a lot of fails, lol. ONLY BECAUSE, everything was freaking me out!! But I did end up giving Fernando that hand massager , early yeah I suck at waiting to give gifts , and I must say, he has not stopped using it. I gave it a couple of tries as well and I have been liking it, also the foot massager, big hit. Haven’t tried the other two again but will report back. Anyways, I think we need more gift ideas, let me know down below, haha.

Hi friends ! 
   Hope you’re having a wonderful day and your week was great. Here was my Thursday, great time as you can see. lol. Fern was at work and that is why he didn’t decorate with me, I noticed I forgot to mention that. So I took it upon myself to just finesse a tree up myself while I was in the MOOD. I went with color throw up all over the tree and I kind of like it. Wish my phone would capture the tree better because , its just not doing it justice and I’m offended. 
 Check out the show on Netflix called DARK  , its pretty good.. they lost me towards the end but its pretty good! More vlogs? Let me know im all ears !!! Have a wonderful rest of your day and I will be seeing you very soon.

 Happy Halloweeener ! Here is a bomb smokey eye that I honestly would normally steer away from but, I am really in to it. haaayyyyy. hahaha. This is great for going out or just BECAUSE. Its just makeup, it washes off, so PLAY with what you got and try those colors you normally wouldn’t try. Especially on halloween, I mean , perfect excuse to try it. Hope youre having a wonderful day today , I love and appreciate you more than you know. I will be seeing you guys very soon !

Hi friends ! 
 Hope your week is off to a good start. I wanted to share a tutorial on how to do a high pony, for all my short hair girls out there. Don’t worry, long hair girls can still use these products too. Its super easy and has been my go to style for a bit now. Im in this weird phase of my hair where I kind of hate everything and this pony has been a life saver. Im going to pull an Ariana grande and rock it until, lord only knows how long. Let me know what you think and if you give it a try ! OH I said I got the hair piece for 10 dollars well now checking amazon where I purchased and its up to 17 dollars… womp womp. I mean that’s still dang cheap but, now im just a liar. hahahah. SORRRRY!

Hi friends ! 
 Hope you like this tutorial on a devil look…? Really don’t know what to name it just wanted an excuse to paint myself red/pink and wear some horns, lets be real. Its fun sometimes to just sit and paint yourself what can I say? But I hope you enjoy the process as much as I do. Also, sorry if the sound is too low, I can’t find a happy medium , its either too loud and muffled sounding or too low, working on that. Other than that though, I appreciate you so much for watching and subscribing , liking, commenting, disliking, it really means more than you know! I love you guys so much and I will be seeing you very soon !

Hi friends ! 
 Sorry I didn’t upload last week, but im here today with a tutorial using the Dose of Colors Desi x Katy Friendcation palette. I wanted to create something dark and dramatic because, why not? Its just makeup, it washes off! Dont be afraid to dive into those darker colors because at the end of the day, it all comes off, you know what I’m saying? Yeahhh DO IT!  
Anyways, let me know what you think! I appreciate you so much for watching, liking, subscribing, everything, it really means more than you know and I cant say thank you enough. I will be seeing you very soon

Hi Friends 
  I went to home goods and bought some home decor, heres what I got. I thought I got a lot more but turns out, no. hahah. I love home decor and if you do too, then we can be BFFS, I don’t ask for much I guess. where do you like to shop for home decor? I need some wall art and then I think I will be done decorating for awhile, it’s 4:30 A.M. and I’m not making a lot of sense, or maybe I am ?
 Home tour will be coming once my lights come in and I find some wall art ! Hope you have a wonderful day today, also, please know I am being sarcastic 99.9% of the time haha .. dont eat bath salts. 
Love and appreciate you guys sooooo much and I will be seeing you very soon

Hi friends ! 
 Few had asked to make a tutorial on how to use the Gua Sha tool, so here is a little in-depth on how I use it. 
 Again, some things I dont have answers to as different websites suggest different things. Do what you feel is right for YOU or feel free to do more research. Dont go longer than 10 minutes a day and dont have heavy pressure, your face is a delicate flower. 
 Any oil/serum/moisturizer will work , as long as your face has a slickness to it , dont attempt to do it on dry skin. 
 Hope you are having a wonderful day today! I appreciate you all so much for watching, commenting, liking, subscribing, it means more than you know.

321,"How to cover hyper pigmentation, dark spots galore! Simple Makeup Routine | Bailey Sarian",2018-08-15,36380.0,2389,162,"Hi friends! 
First and foremost thank you IT Cosmetics for partnering with me on this tutorial. I love IT Cosmetics because their products are developed with plastic surgeons so the formulas are not only skin-loving but also clinically-proven.  I know it’s a pain when you have dark spots or discoloration on the skin, but it’s easier to cover than you think and a lot cheaper than all those laser treatments. I’ve had the dark under eyes for over 6 years now and have tried it all, I’ve learned to just embrace it and it’s apart of me now. Don’t ever feel bad for not having “perfect” skin, you are perfect just the way you are but if the discoloration does bother you, having the right products can help boost your confidence. If you're interested in the product Bye Bye Under Eye, which is expanding from 12 to 48 shades, including the darkest concealer shade on the market,  it will be available at ULTA : https://www.ulta.com/bye-bye-under-eye-full-coverage-anti-aging-concealer?productId=xlsImpprod5770259&cmpid=BV_it_cosmetics_instagram_swipeup_FY18WK29
 

I hope you love the look as much as I do. Love and appreciate you guys so much

Hi friends !
 A few have asked for a drugstore tutorial, so here is one mixed in with a get ready , chit chat, rambling Bailey, tutorial ! yay. haha. Honestly, loved the look so much , that lip....whew. What do you think of the final look? 
ALSO, were moving! yay! so, get ready for a switch up . Im so ready for a new , creative space where I can be the best version of myself cuz girrrrrllll, this place is so draining ! I really like filming GRWM videos, just hanging and talking with you guys and hope you like them too. Youtube is weird, doesn't tell anyone when creators upload , doesn't show everyone your videos, its frustrating and over all, nobody really watches JUST tutorials anymore so, I feel like a GRWM is a good way to still do a tutorial and then just ramble on. But let me know what you guys like. Once we move I want to do more lookbooks or just clothing hauls, wig talks, everything, it should be easier to do so because we will have a little bit more space , yay . 
 Hope you have a wonderful day today and I will be seeing you guys VERY SOON

324,Bailey Does... Paranormal Investigation 👻  Is my apartment haunted? A Ghost Grandma?,2018-07-25,319230.0,19617,963,"Bailey Does... Paranormal Investigation - Is my apartment haunted? A Ghost Grandma? 

Please watch this video is you want some background as to whats been happening in my place : https://youtu.be/y2GyFX3HzNk

Hi friends !
 Some of you may remember I uploaded a video explaining my experiences with some odd things happening in the house, well, its only gotten more odd around here. We decided to bring in some experts Mona and Karen who are paranormal investigators and help people cleanse or get rid of spirits from their homes. 
 Coming into this they really knew nothing about me, what was going on and only told me what they felt. They were so kind, helpful  and left me with the tools I needed to get rid of that yucky energy around here. Also, they do not charge to come and cleanse a house, which is amazing, they do it because they want to help, reasons for me to believe haha. 
 I do realize there are no ""ghost machines"" happening in here that detect spirits or sell you guys on the whole idea, so I understand if you do not believe me, but I KNOW, this apartment sucks and there is weird stuff constantly happening. The good news, we found a new apartment and are moving August 1st. hahahah.. Also, my apartment looks really shitty but thats LA and everything is really shitty looking unless you have a million bucks , so, theres that. 
 Since Mona and Karen have left, we have noticed things getting a little worse , weird noises, lights flashing, things moving, its been terrible for a chicken like myself. If you follow me on snapchat we have even caught the ghosts on camera , thank you sooo much. Im rambling but this whole thing has been weird and I just cant wait to get out of here. 
 What are your thoughts?

Big thank you to Mona and Karen for coming over and find more information on what they do here 
 www.calpara.org

Karen also has a paranormal Podcast! Check it out here

Hi friends !
 Every year I go to the thrift store, straight to the mens section and pick up some Levis mens jeans. For starters, theyre always on sale (nobody is buying pants in summer) and mens jeans are always high waisted and great for making into shorts. I highlight suggest getting some jeans you dont wear or go to the thrift store and make your own shorts! The different looks you can create are endless. 
 Let me know what you think and if you would like to see a more advanced version with some bleach ! 
Hope you have a wonderful and i will be seeing you very soon !!!

Hi friends !
 Sorry for the lighting, the sound and my camera not recording mid eye. lol. Filming at home is always a struggle. The camera stopped recording when I was doing my lower lash line but I used the eyeliner ""Torch"" in the water line and the bronzed shades along the lash line as well. Nothing too crazy happened when I was filming that part.
OTHER than that, hope you like the video, little story and look I created. 
 Hope your weekend has been good and I will be seeing you guys very soon!!!

I know how nit picky the internet is and im sure someone will point out my hair everywhere but, when filming, I didn't see it. so annoying ! 
 What do you think of the look? Let me know down below . 
Love and appreciate you guys soooo much ! Thank you for taking the time to leave a comment, subscribe or just lurk, I appreciate youuuu!

Dont forget to like and subscribe for more Bailey Does because IM HERE TO TRY AND LEARN EVERYTHINNGGGG

Hi friends !

 On this episode of Bailey does, I try some wine. I consider myself not a fan of wine, at all. I dont understand it, why the fancy glasses, why people smell their wine, the clear stuff , the red stuff, I just dont understand. Am I missing something? 

 I wanted to learn MORE about it and understand the differences between it all. Just want to say a BIG thank you to Malibu Wine Hikes for letting me come by and see the animals , the scenery and try the wine. If youre looking for a good date spot, I highly suggest Malibu Wine Hikes, BEAUTIFUL place! And also to Ian for really deep diving with me and understanding wine. 

Let me know what you would like me to try for future Bailey Does episodes because I am down to TRY IT ALLLL! 
I appreciate you so much for watching, I'll be seeing you very soon

358,"im a mess, a Valentines Day Makeup Tutorial - Bailey Sarian",2018-02-10,22243.0,2362,307,"Hi friends ! 
 Sorry for the big delay on my end and not getting a video up. I have no excuse, this week flew by and work kept me busy. I just gave excuses when I said I have no excuse.. ANYWAYS. This tutorial is um, fun ? haha. You see I originally had this idea for a cool pink look but things went wrong and I decided to go in a different direction. Still cute but a little sloppy ! Also, the lighting was a bit off but, when im filming at home everything looks fine, then I come to edit and its a different story so, im not sure what is going on?! 2018 ima get it right. Hope you had a wonderful week and lets have a great one ahead. Let me know what you want to see from me next and I will be seeing you soon!! Dont worry, I won't disappear for a week.

359,Lady Gaga Grammy Inspired Makeup Tutorial | Bailey Sarian,2018-02-03,34819.0,2903,288,"Hi friends !
 I was very inspired by Lady Gagas look for the 2018 Grammy Awards, the shimmer, the imperfect perfection on her eyes had me very inspired. Lady Gaga's Makeup artist Sarah Tanno aka @sarahtannomakeup on instagram, had created this beautiful look on gaga and also listed the products she used on her, using the products I had, I tried my best to recreate it. This is the internet so I know people are going to say it looks nothing like it, im not gaga, etc etc... Im aware its not an exact copy ,  just my attempt at it and I love how it came out ! I think her makeup artist is very inspiring and always coloring outside of the lines, I LOVE THAT !
 If you would like to see more recreations let me know in the comments below. I would love to do more .
Lets have a great day today and I will see you guys very soon!

 Here is a tutorial on my ""natural"" or easy, go to face I do when im going somewhere and I dont really want to do anything crazy on my face. haha.

And please, dont ever feel like you have to use the exact same products I have in my tutorials! Use what you have ! I have a foundation drawer that is currently out of control so, you might be seeing me mix in some new foundations . I cant help but think of all the money wasted on these products and im just sitting on them, how dare I ! Hope you have a wonderful day today, I appreciate you so much for watching, subscribing,  commenting, whatever you do out there in the world, I appreciate you!!! Lets have a good day today and I'll be seeing you very soon

Hi Friends ! 
 Hope you are having a great week so far. Have any of you started holiday shopping? Yeah, about that.. Im always the last minute type of person. ANYWHO! I wanted to play with that beautiful, frosty blue shade that can be a bit tricky to pull off. But have NO FEAR! I am here to bring you this Snow globe glam! 
 I hope you bust out any frosty blue shadows you have and give their look a whirl. If you do, don't forget to tag me in your photos, I love to see what you guys do!
 Just remember, its just makeup, it washes off. Have some fun and lighten up a bit . 
 Also, I used a lotttt of stuff in this tutorial and I personally am not a fan of that, but always use what you HAVE. You don't need to go and buy a bunch of stuff to do this look. Im sure you may already have a lot of the colors just sitting in your drawer.
 Lets have a great rest of the day and I will be seeing you very soon.

google search will bring her up : BOBBI BOSS PREMIUM SYNTHETIC SWISS LACE FRONT WIG - MLF136 YARA
Color - TT1B/DTEAL

Hi friends! 

 Hope you like this tut on how I achieved this red, orange, glitter, cut crease. Honestly, I had no idea where I was going with this when I first started hahahaha... GIRL, the struggle to film this. I kept getting distracted, obviously. Never again will I film with the TV on, takes me twice as long.  

 Do we like the products being shown on the screen? I, personally, am a visual person and like to see the product but hate trying to hold the item up and get the camera to focus, never goes well. I know rough life, but I do it for you. Let me know, I kind of enjoy adding an image in there, keeps things interesting. But if its too much, just let me knowww.

 This look is great for fall, going out, date night, girls night, going to target, going to a show, staying in and watching TV, scrolling on instagram, selfies, going grocery shopping, going to church, walking around in your PJS, thanksgiving dinner, christmas morning, walking your dog, getting the mail, going to work, working the corner, birthday parties, kids parties... all of these ?! you are thinking?! YES...because its just makeup and you can do whatever you want, it all washes off.   

 Lets have a great day ahead and I will be seeing you very soon.

 I purchased the Kat Von D Saint and Sinner palette and out of all the fun choices , I did a brown smokey eye. haha. I promise I will do another look with this palette because there are so many looks you can create with this beauty. 
 I did use this palette for a few halloween looks I did on clients and I must say they are very pretty shades, creamy, easy to work with and pigmented. If you're looking to purchase, I would. But, like I mentioned in the video, only if you see yourself using the shadows. 
 Let me know what colors you would like to see me use and I can make that happen. 
 I also tried to mainly focus on just eyeshadow tutorial and speed through the rest of my face. Do we like this from time to time or do you prefer the whole face tutorials? 
 Lets have a great day and I will be seeing you very soon!

Hi Friends! 
 Hope this video helps you out in some sort of way. I know wigs can sometimes look really WIGGY! So, I wanted to show you guys what I do to blend and make my wigs look somewhat ""natural"" . Also, the wig I purchased and am using in this tutorial , its called ""Denise"" , I didn't just give it a random name, hahaha.
 Honestly, if you have a lot of wigs or are thinking about wearing wigs often, the Wolfe Palette is worth it or find a waterproof root spray to help you out (I didn't have luck with one but I'm sure they are out there).
 The Wolfe Palette is either water or alcohol activated, I used the alcohol because its dries down matte and does not move when I sweat or get hot (which is often). 
 Let me know what you think and if this helps you out. Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

 I hope you love this tutorial trying to recreate Amy Winehouse Iconic Look. I loved Amy's voice and talent so much and she was taken from us way too soon, it makes me so sad!! But I know I'm not alone as many of you guys share your love for her too! 
I hope I did her look some kind of justice but I am in no means claiming to look like her and its just an INSPIRED tutorial (because I know people are going to comment their little fingers away saying how I did this or that wrong)
I noticed I forgot to say, make good choices wahhh! With Halloween approaching please with everything in you, make good choices, don't drink and drive. Uber, lyft, call a friend, call triple A, Call your dad/mom/S.O., Just don't be dumb and drive. Random but, it happens a lot around this time of year and I would love for you all to be SAFE. 
Hope you are having a great week so far and I will be seeing you very soon.

385,Cheap 💰 Wig Haul 🔥 - Bailey Sarian,2017-10-24,61391.0,2999,249,"Hi friends ! 
 Hope your week is off to a good start! I know you guys have been asking for me to share some wigs I have purchased so here is a wig haul with the inexpensive wigs. I have some more expensive wigs I purchased as well, which I can do a separate video on those if you want? 
I bought so many of these wigs just different shades of brown/black , so when I say on twitter and snapchat that I have a problem.... I think I have a problem. haha. I can't stop! 
Some of them appear really shiny, that is because the lighting but also they were just out of the bag and I hadn't powdered them yet ! I usually use dry shampoo or translucent powder/baby powder to get rid of that shine. It tends to make it look real fake. 
I kept touching my hair in the videos to show how it moved and looked in the lighting but, I did realize how much I was doing it? haha sorry. 
 ANYWHO, after I filmed this video I was like, I think I need more COLOR so I bought all colored wigs and I will have to make another video on those. ha geez.
 Hope you like it and I will be seeing you guys very soon!

386,DEVIL POP ART TUTORIAL - BAILEY SARIAN,2017-10-19,38567.0,2598,193,"Hi friends! 
 Sorry for the big delay on this tutorial but its up now!! I love this look and I love how it came out, I think its fun and cute. I would say its easy but I struggled, just with the body paint, the rest is just lines, and that is easy my friends . 
I should have practiced this look first before filming it, then I would have had more time to do the rest of my body but of course, I didn't. its more fun when its a surprise and I have no idea what I'm doing, hahaha. 
Anyways, let me know if you like it, love it, what you think. Maybe it'll inspire you to have some fun. 
Hope youre having a wonderful week so far!!  Don't forget to follow me on snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, twitter, whatever you use, I'm usually there!! Especially my Facebook because Im going to start doing giveaways on there as I am making my rounds on all of my social media platforms and giving goodies away. No tricks, just my treats.

25% Off Your First Purchase Discount Code: SNAP15

Hi Friends! I am excited to be working with Catrice Cosmetics and show you guys how to achieve that smooth, glowing, luminous skin that SNAPCHAT ALWAYS GIVES YOUUUU! But really, why does that Snapchat Heart Filter always look so good???

Luminous, glowing, smooth skin is a lot easier to achieve than you think (and thats coming from someone who is currently having major skin issues. If you have been following me on snapchat you knoowwwww) so I have faith you can easily recreate this look yourself.

The headband I made with some paper and pipe cleaner and TADAAAAAA, easy last minute halloween costume? Maybe? I like to get crafty. 

Let me know if you pick up anything from Catrice cosmetics, if you try this look, if you love this look, if you want more like this look, if you just want to say hi, you can do that too. 

Thank you all so much for your love and support , it means more than you know. I appreciate you all so much.

HI FRIENDS!
 Sorry I LAGGED big time this week getting a video up. I have excuses but, excuses excuses, I know. Im here now showing you how I created this easy purple smokey eye! It came out so cute and its been awhile since I've done a purple smokey eye, I mean I can't remember the last time I did one.

ANYWHO, Hope your week has been good so far and if you are in the areas of these California fires I am praying for your safety ! WE ARE GOING THROUGH IT THIS YEAR ARENT WE??? Im here for you! If you know any families directly or a website where we can find families to send everyday items to, who lost everything, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I heard donating through the Red Cross wasn't the best when it came to these types of disasters but I would love to send stuff, just don't know where...

Thank you for your love and support , always. It means more than you guys know !!!!!

p.s. if I made t-shirts what would you want them to say? I have a few ideas but maybe I'm missing some...? 

Until next time

390,Queen Of The Damned Inspired - Halloween Tutorial | Bailey Sarian,2017-10-04,55885.0,3937,317,"My DIY Head Piece Tutorial : https://youtu.be/L9IjTPRzfhg


Hi Friends! 
 Happy October! I hope you are having a wonderful week so far. I know thats hard to say with the awful event that happened in Las Vegas and before that, the hurricanes, earth quakes, fires, ugh, the list goes on. At this time I feel pretty down and a little hopeless with all of the BAD that this world is going through. I feel like there is no right thing to say or do, but please know, I am here if you need to talk or I hope I can help in some way bring some sort of break from it all. I didn't want to upload but , I don't know what the right thing to do is. Im here for you and I know it doesn't mend broken or hurting hearts but I am praying for you and all of those affected by these events.

October seems to be the month when we can be creative, let loose and have some fun with our makeup. I challenge you to just have some fun because at the end of the day, its just makeup and it always washes off. 
I made this head piece and wasn't even sure what look I wanted to do. I decided to go with a Queen of the damned inspired look but then I mention ripping someones heart out? haha, so I'm a zombie vampire? Hell, I'm whatever you want it to be, but I'm good at it. 
Hope you like this video, it took me foreverrrrr to edit! I tried. Have a great day today, make good choices and I will be seeing you very soon.
p.s. head piece tutorial?

This video is NOT sponsored, I received PR from Huda Beauty Team, which I am so grateful to receive. 
I personally have NEVER tried any products from Huda Beauty so I had to review, swatch and give the palette a WHIRL! 
Let me know if you like these types of videos and what products you would like to see reviewed , maybe I can make that happen. Im kind of broke right now so, key word, maybe. ha. Keepin it real here folks. Rent was due. 
Anyways, I love and appreciate you guys SO MUCH! I hope you do subscribe and stay awhile, I always forget to mention that in my videos. It makes me uncomfortable because, I don't know, I can't stand when you click to watch a tutorial and the person rambles for 5 minutes about liking subscribing and doing the most. I just don't want to be that person, hahaha. I over think things, maybe? 
Hope you're having a wonderful week so far, lots of love sent your way. Stay strong in these tough times. Im with you!!!

396,1st Impressions Update After 1Month Of Use | Bailey Sarian,2017-08-31,59876.0,3067,187,"Original 1st Impressions Fail : https://youtu.be/SZLeGd854UU

Hi Friends!
 Hope you are having a wonderful day so far. I wanted to give my ""first impressions"" On these products that I tried earlier this month! I hate that sometimes we try things 1 time and 1 time only, then base everything off of that first try. Sometimes products just need to be paired with something else or different application techniques are tried in order for it to work best. 
Ive given these products a good run and am here to report back what I have liked and didn't like.
Let me know if you would like to see a first impression at the beginning of the month and then an update at the end! I think its kind of fun.
Also, this video is just all around random, so, yeah. 
I appreciate you so much for watching , hope you know that!

and if you are in the southern Texas area , I doubt you are watching this tutorial but, please know you are in my thoughts and prayers and I have donated what I could in hopes to help. Please skip your morning coffee and donate what you can here:

Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund
https://ghcf.org/hurricane-relief/

I wish there was more I could do.

397,Vibrant Green Smokey Eyes | Bailey Sarian,2017-08-29,50598.0,3443,383,"My Bushy Boy Brow Tutorial  : https://youtu.be/1oRCo6xASUQ

Hi Friends! 
 Sorry I haven't uploaded in a couple of days, but I'm here now with this hot green eyeshadow look. 
Dude, this HAIR is my favorite and I'm not sure why it took me so long to go back to dark. I felt in a rut with the blonde and I needed some CHANGE! So glad I got this wig !
Its from Freedom Couture and yes I purchased it myself, yes it was stupid expensive -__- but I feel good and I haven't felt this good in a long time. 
I really hope you like this tutorial and you give it a try. 
Lets have a great rest of the week 
and if you are in the Houston area, I doubt you are watching this tutorial but, please know you are in my thoughts and prayers and I have donated what I could , please skip your morning Starbucks and donate what you can here:

Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund
https://ghcf.org/hurricane-relief/

I wish there was more I could do. 

Let me know what you think, whats going on, what you wanna see, whats good....
love and appreciate you guys SOOO MUCH!!!!

402,NEW PRODUCT - FAILED FIRST IMPRESSIONS  | Bailey Sarian,2017-08-03,97035.0,5514,1439,"GIVEAWAY CLOSED 


Hi friends! 
 I got some new products and I really wanted to try them out and see how they worked but also create a bomb look! obviously, it didn't go according to plan. 
I will update you at the end of the month to check in and let you know if I gave the product a try again and my thoughts. I don't believe trying a product ONCE means you get the full idea of it. I have hope the foundation and eyeliner are winners, I know I'm approaching them wrong. But, I'll keep you guys posted. 
Thank you for all the love and support it means a lot. I'll be seeing you guys really soon.

403,FULL COVERAGE BLURRING MATTE FOUNDATION - NEW MILK MAKEUP REVIEW,2017-08-01,50030.0,2030,218,"Hi friends!! I want to start doing more product reviews on my channel. To kick off this idea, I am starting with the new milk makeup blur foundation. Claims to have full coverage, matte finish , blurs skin and can work with ANY SKIN TYPE.
This video itself is a little janky but, oh well, I tried. If you would like to see more review type videos, let me know! 

* HOW IT WORE UPDATE :
 Overall, the foundation wore really well for me. I gave my dog, saint , a bath, worked around the house and did some errands. My chin and forehead got really shiny but it wasn't anything major that would make me dislike it. Is it truly keeping me MATTE all day, no. I think pairing it with a matte foundation primer would help absorb the shine but, for myself because I am so dry, I dont mind that it wasn't sucking all of the hydration out of my skin. 
I will be using this throughout the week and hopefully so on. Im also thinking about doing end of the month updates with product reviews because, like I mentioned, I'm not a huge fan with the ONE TIME type of review. 
Let me know what you think, if you'll be trying this or whatever else is on your mind :)
Hope you are having a wonderful week . I'll be seeing you really soon

405,Super Hot Summer Vampire Look | Bailey Sarian,2017-07-25,13184.0,1413,239,"Hi friends!!!! 
 Hope you are having a good week so far. This look is my favorite because , its different and its fun to just play sometimes. Its just makeup, I know I said it a lot, but you gotta remember,  its fun, Its not that serious and if you want to play with your makeup, and play with different looks, THEN DO IT! 
Makeup does not define you , you can be whoever you feel like being for the day or the hour, it ALWAYS washes off. 
I hope you do remember that and just lighten up. 
I appreciate you so much for watching, commenting, liking, disliking, subscribing, it all means SO MUCH. Even the hate or dislikes I get , I appreciate because making people uncomfortable or dislike me, does mean I'm staying true to myself and what I WANT TO DO, not what THEY WANT ME TO DO... 
Life is too short, lets have a good day today :)
Lots of love

411,Venice Beach Inspired Eyes | Bailey Sarian,2017-07-04,43788.0,3710,345,"Hi Guys! 
Hope you are having a great week so far. This tutorial was so hard to edit because I was all over the place, jeeeeez.. But I tried some text on the screen saying what products I was using, yay or nay on that for future videos ? I always appreciate your guys feedback and the only reason I'm doing it is FOR YOU. So, let me know. 
Blue is rarely a color I gravitate towards but I figured it was time to bust out the blue. If it isn't the shade for you, have no fear, use any pop of color you want. Just remember, its only makeup and it does wash off, so DONT be afraid to just PLAY! 
ALSO, my hair was a disaster and I don't know what I was thinking, hahahahahahahahaah.. my bad. You should've saw the back, it was way worse. cmon Bailey get it together. 
I love and appreciate you guys so much. Please let me know what you would love to see in the future.

Its kind of, all over the place, as usual and I didn't answer too many questions about clients, kits,brushes, etc... which I'm going to do next. just strictly answer your questions. 
I just wanted to share my story. There was so much more to it but it was turning into a 45 minute video and honestly, nobody got time for that!! so I cut a lot out and condensed it. If it seems a little choppy that is why! 
I appreciate you guys so much for watching and hope you follow your passion in life because you never know where you might end up!!!
Ill be seeing you really soon

Hey guys !!
 I hope you're all have a great week so far. You asked for it, so here it is. What happened with me and bob, you ask? Ugh, so much. 
 Thank you for hanging with me as I cracked open my 8th grade diary. We laughed, we laughed-cried but most of all, we laughed. The last page of this diary was just that, the ending of 8th grade and my promotion, I planned that out pretty well! Like I said, I could keep going forever as I still keep a diary to this day.
  But most of all, I just wanted to share this side of my life, keep it real, and if anything, remind myself and you guys, how far we've come in this game of life! Don't forget to laugh at yourself and stop stressing over the small stuff. Now, I'm off to social media stalk Bryan and see where that d-bag is at. 
Love and appreciate you guys so much

NO, it doesn't last like microblading would but its great if you don't want to commit to microblading. Let me know what you think, if you try it, and how your week was!

I wanted to create this EASY tutorial that is one of my ""go-to"" looks , no false lashes needed. I really hope you like this tutorial and let me know what you think. 
After uploading I realized I didn't add an ""intro"" , ""outro"" or music, I guess my brain is on vacation ! Hope its okay! I kind of like the no background music but I don't know if its awkward or fine, so, let me know down below :)
I know not everyone reads this but if you do, hi, thank you for coming by, I appreciate you more than you know!

430,Sunday Smokey Eyezzz | Bailey Sarian,2017-04-16,34047.0,2288,160,"* I had some issues with this video, I know! Theres ALWAYS SOMETHING wrong in my videos!! Drives me nuts. Anyways, around 6:00 time mark the sound lowers (I tried to fix it as best as I could)
then around 8:00mins the colors got all thrown off. I appear extremely orange at some parts. Which mixed with my self tanner, Oompa Loompa is the best way to describe what is happening. Again, I TRIED TO FIX IT! Im not the best when it comes to editing, I'm still learning, and I have a lot to learn, is what Im realizing. Sorry about it ! I will get better!
 
Hope you are having a wonderful week so far!
Just decided to sit down and FILM, something, anything, so this tutorial is a little, all over the place. Haha. 
Majority of the time when I film, I don't have a plan, I just sit down and hope for the best, sometimes it goes smoothly and sometimes I'm a little frazzled. 
Hope you like this tutorial! Its different, its dramatic, and at the end of the day, its just makeup, it washes off. 
Have some fun! 
I want to go back though and film just a plain brown smokey eye because I kind of liked where it was going. 
Let me know if I should film that.
Love and appreciate you guys, more than you know! Hope you had or are having a wonderful Easter Sunday! If you don't celebrate easter then I hope you are just having a wonderful day regardless. Love love love you guys

Hey guys!
 Hope you like this diary read, its just getting more and more embarrassing. hahahahaha! 
Please do know this, don't feel bad for me, its HILARIOUS and I want to remind you guys to not sweat the small stuff. Looking back I used to take things SO SERIOUSLY and thought how could I ever survive this cruel middle school world?!!! 
Its funny how we can get so caught up in the moment, we forget that life keeps going, and things that seemed to be SO TERRIBLE, usually are just a bunch of nonsense.
Hope this video makes you LAUGH because it made me ugly-laugh-cry.
Hope you have a wonderful day today! I'll be seeing you really soon.

435,UD x Jean-Michel Basquiat Collection - Swatches and Tutorial,2017-03-25,35262.0,2036,183,"Dear everyone , I am completely aware that he has passed. When I say ""collab"" I mean , collaboration with his BRAND. He has passed, yes I know, but his name is a Brand. 
I left that part out about him dying of a heroin overdose because I have seen comments of people upset that urban would collab with someone who had a drug problem , so to keep it light and happy, I just left that out. I appreciate everyone trying to ""come after me"" in the comments about this, hahaha, but Im not an idiot, Im aware and its a makeup tutorial, take a deep breath, its going to be ok. 
p.s. I Delete mean/rude comments so you're just wasting your time.

Basquiat Collection Available 4/20

Hi guys! First of all, Im filming in my new room. Sad about the white walls but its better than nothing, thats for sure. I am sorry there was so much background noise. Its extremely busy over here and it was impossible to get some silence. The lighting is off but, we survived. Hope you like this video showcasing the urban decay x basquiat collection ! I personally really like it and find the packaging STUNNING! Big fan of his work and happy to see a brand partner with an amazing artist. 
In the future I want to get better at doing SWATCHES and showing the product. Usually, I just jump right in to a tutorial, which I can still do but I'd like to include some swatches from time to time. This was quickly put together so, hopefully you don't mind how choppy it is. Im tired. hahahaha.. hope you had a wonderful week and weekend ahead !!!!! Love and appreciate you guys so much ! Thank you for always showing me lots of love and support , it means more than you know.

https://youtu.be/4xhB52OMLCE

Hey guys! 
I know this is a little different , but I'm giving it to you RAW right from the diary of 8th grade Bailey.
Feeling inspired by the ""Mortified"" Podcast, I wanted to just sit, and read my 8th grade diary. Keep in mind, things were a little different then, I was an OVERDRAMATIC teenager, who was extremely awkward to say the least. The only type of social media we had was AIM, and that was brand new . haha.. oh man.
I dont want anyone to feel BAD for me, I just want to show you how ridiculous I was and share a LAUGH. Life is one crazy ride. The things you SWORE you would never survive, a few years later you look back laugh and wonder, ""why was I so worried?!"". Just remember, life is short, don't sweat the small stuff :) learn to laugh at yourself and not take everything so seriously!!! If you'd like to see more give this video a like or leave a comment 
hope you guys have a wonderful day. I'll be seeing you really soon

I just wanted to have some fun with my mom and show that!

440,Back 2 Basics - How To Apply False Eyelashes | Bailey Sarian,2017-03-08,101648.0,5623,193,"HEY GUYS!
Sorry I havent uploaded in awhile, I've been MOVING! Yay! Im so happy we found a place ! It has been the most stressful experience , that is FOR SURE. Being an adult sucks, why did we not get any warning when we were young? Okay, maybe I did , I just didn't pay attention
ANYWAYS! I know a lot of you are not big fans of the plain backgrounds but have NO FEAR! I am putting my room together and we will be back in my room, well, a new room, but you get the point, soon.
I appreciate you guys SO MUCH for all of your love and support, it really means a lot! 
I hope this video helps you feel more confident with applying false eyelashes. I remember when I first started wearing them, it was a STRUGGLE. But with some practice , you'll get it down in no time, promise. 
Let me know what you think, what you like, whats going on.
Hope you're having a wonderful week so far and i will be seeing you very soon.

Also, don't try to rip off the stopper of the concealer with your teeth, that hurt my mouth. 
hahaha.. HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL HOLIDAY !
Enjoy the time with your friends, family and loved ones. 
And if any of you get an extra Hatichimal for christmas and have no idea what to do with it, i'll take it for you.

It was an amazing experience and I feel so blessed to have been able to go. I never thought it a bazillion years I would get the opportunity to travel to Tokyo, seriously. I am looking forward to the day I can go back! I was so surprised with myself that I did NOT purchase any eyelashes, I  didn’t even notice until I got home that I didn’t buy any. Weird. But I did get a few random products and some new stuff that I HAVE BEEN LOVING! Thank you for coming by, watching, commenting, it means a lot. Love and appreciate you guys so much !!

462,Sunset Eyes & A New Foundation - Hot Mess Tutorial,2016-11-20,32871.0,2194,164,"*** 
Hahaha I didn’t even want to upload this but out of anger and annoyance, i decided to go with it. I thought it would be a good idea to try a new spot in my room, but the lighting FAILED ME. it starts off pretty good then things just start to go downhill. I was so frustrated trying to find the correct setting that I just started getting flustered and annoyed and , you can just tell because I’m all over the place.BUT, I wanted to upload this for two reasons, 1. I have filmed 4 tutorials in the last 2 days and they all bad lighting and i couldn't upload or fix any of them waaahhh and 2. There are still some good tips in this video that I think you should try! The wet sponge and the Just for men gel :) 
haha
This weeks lesson,
If it aint broke, don’t fix it. 
sincerely,

Just another day :) can't say my life is super glam! Im usually walking around ugly 80% of my day then eventually I get ready and do some work. haha. Thank you for coming by. Keep vloggin?

Hey guys! 
Hope you like this video of my june/july favorites ! These are my no bullshit , ""Im in love"" products! Hope you find some of your next favorites from this. I also can't wait to share with you guys these music videos I have gotten the opportunity to work on (doing makeup not actually in it ;) ) as soon as those come out I will let you guys know! Unless you don't really care and just want tutorials, thats fine too and I can just stick with that. haha. 
Also, my internet sucks, I'm not kidding this took about 6 hours to upload, it was such a joke. It would've taken longer if I didn't drive and  go steal someones wifi from the parking lot. The things I do !
Hope you have a great week ahead and I will be seeing you guys very soon ! I Love and Appreciate you !!!!

509,"$80, PORN STAR APPROVED - LIPSTAIN // THOUGHTS & CHIT CHAT",2015-11-13,54756.0,1944,185,"Hey guys, so its about 2 am and I was just sitting here, deciding what to do with this damn product, figured I would share my thought process with you, haha. Overall, I must say, it's a really good product. It stays put, does not dry out your lips or do any of that flaky, gross stuff most lip stains do. I guess the only thing that rips me apart is the price, oh and if you do it wrong, it's a mess! So, if you're looking for a lip stain that will stay put swimming, kissing, sleeping, ummm, doing things in front of a camera, I would say, go for it. And NO, the company did not pay me, send me product etc, obviously, since I was complaining about the price. haha. 
Thanks for watching, I know it was kind of a pointless ramble :)
you can find the product here

516,VLOG #2 - JUST ANOTHER SATURDAY -,2015-09-20,40616.0,2580,152,"Heres my second attempt at a vlog, my apologies for being so shaky, I use my phone to record, which tends to capture not my best angles and my shaky hands. I also debated on cutting the tattoo part out because I really don't want to sound like a whiny little brat, but Ive seen people get the same tattoos as I, one girl has almost the exact same sleeve as me, just some minor tweaks. I saw it after seeing a comment of her tagging a tattoo artist, then looked at her instagram and saw it. Its just a bummer, you know? Thats all I was getting at. I just don't want anyone to take it the wrong way. Anyways, let me know if you'd like more vlogs, I know I wasn't the most exciting to follow today. haha. Thank you again for watching, it truly means a lot you have NO IDEA! Love you guys!
