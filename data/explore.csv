If you haven't already heard about it on the news, a Facebook event went viral in July of 2019 called ""Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us"". This joke quickly turned into something real known as Alienstock, planned to be held in the small town of Rachel, Nevada on September 20th. Just a week before the event was scheduled to take place next to Area 51, it began to fall apart.

This video documents the outcome of the event and what REALLY happened there. Did anyone REALLY show up to ""see them aliens""? Did anyone REALLY raid the top secret base, and if so, were they arrested?

This is what happened at Area 51 on September 20th, 2019.

234,AREA 51 RAID BEGINS: People Are ACTUALLY Showing Up At Area 51! DOCUMENTING THE SEPTEMBER 20TH STORM,2019-09-20,573211,14063,1408.0,"The Area 51 Raid is set to take place on September 20th in and around the small town of Rachel, Nevada. People are ACTUALLY showing up at Area 51 and setting up camp. Will they REALLY storm Area 51 and raid the top secret base? We will find out today...

Storm Area 51 started as a Facebook event that went viral in July of 2019, jokingly planned to take place on September 20th. When it reached 2,000,000 people pledging to attend, the event garnered national attention and was featured on mainstream news.

Meanwhile, the creator of the Facebook event - Matty Roberts - attempted to evolve this meme into a real music festival known as Alienstock, planned for the same day as the original joke. However, this event quickly fell apart just a week before it was scheduled to take place.

Will there ACTUALLY be a raid on Area 51? Join us as we go to Area 51 to investigate around the base and see what preparations are being made before the big event...

Meanwhile, the Storm Area 51 event that originally started as just a joke has evolved into an ACTUAL FESTIVAL. This event - known as Alienstock - is planned for September 20th, 2019, the same date as the original joke... but things have fallen apart between its two organizers, Matty Roberts and Connie West. Many are confused on whether or not the event is completely CANCELED, while some are planning to go to an entirely different event in Las Vegas.

Two Dutch YouTubers have been ARRESTED for storming Area 51, while the Alienstock event is beginning to fall apart. Has Storm Area 51 REALLY been cancelled as the news is reporting? Watch this video to the very end to learn all of the EXCLUSIVE new details we've uncovered...

BREAKING NEWS: First of all, Dutch YouTubers Ties Grazier and Govert Sweep were arrested on September 10th, 10 days before the joke raid was planned for September 20th. The news has reported that Ties and Govert's vehicle was found 3 MILES inside Area 51, and both were arrested for trespassing into the top secret base. According to the pair, they didn't travel to the United States to storm Area 51. They say they were planning on leaving the country a day before the raid is supposed to take place.

Secondly, the Alienstock event planned in Rachel, Nevada is beginning to fall apart. Matty Roberts, creator of the viral Facebook event ""Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us"" is reported to have completely abandoned the event, leaving Connie to pick up the pieces and continue to hold the festival. Will Alienstock become the next Fyre Festival? We talked to Connie of the Little A'Le'Inn for exclusive details and dug up information that's never been revealed before.

On September 20th, a new event is in the works: Alienstock. This festival is scheduled to take place next to Area 51 in the nearby town of Rachel, Nevada.

Storm Area 51 was a Facebook event that went viral in July of 2019. Many joked about raiding the top secret base to ""see them aliens"", while others wondered what would really happen if people actually showed up on September 20th. Would anyone ACTUALLY attempt to enter Area 51, and if so, how would an Area 51 raid be handled? If anyone actually managed to get inside, would they find aliens and UFOs?

If you were looking forward to this event, we have some bad news for you... Sadly, it seems to be quickly spiraling into something similar to the disastrous Fyre Festival.

""HISTORY

Modena grew up in the area of Desert Springs and Indian Springs in Kane County, Utah. 

The exact source of the name is hard to pin down. One source states that an Italian laborer named the railroad camp after Modena, Italy. Another source relates that a Chinese cook during the serving of dinner would call out periodically, ""Mo'dinna, mo'dinna"". 

With the arrival of the railroad in the Modena area in December 1899, the town grew up to supply water for the steam engines and as a railhead for shipping products into and out of the area. There was a lot of wagon traffic between Modena and St. George 

Brigham J. Lund, along with two partners, E. M. Brown and Jose Price, started a small business venture here. In time they were freighting to St. George, Utah; Pioche, Nevada and Delamar. Lund soon bought out his partners and in 1903 incorporated under the name of B. J. Lund & Company. The name ""Lund"" is still found on several buildings in town including the General Merchandise & Hotel building. 

By 1903, a U.S. Weather Bureau office had also been established in Modena. ""

341,"THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO BUY THIS FOR $1,000,000 (HOOVER) IN 1936",2017-03-18,129308,2392,236.0,"We didn't expect to find this many buildings at this abandoned ghost town high on the top of a mountain. This place will probably not be around much longer as it appears natural erosion may cause many of the buildings to collapse. 

We didn't know it at the time, but we took the hard road in. There is a much easier road just over the top of the mountain. 

In the summer of 1936, president Hoover visited the mine site. He offered to purchase the mine for $1,000,000 dollars, but the Austin's declined they figured the government would take half of the money in taxes. 

""By 1936, the rich mine was becoming famous – first by word of mouth then by news articles. Austin received two substantial offers to purchase the mine, one from former President Herbert Hoover.

Although Hoover is generally remembered for having been at the helm as the country drifted into the Great Depression, few realize he got his start in life as a miner who made his millions investing in gold mines.  He once famously remarked that a man who had not made a million by 40 years old was not worth much.

Hoover was impressed by what he saw at the Jumbo Mine, and legend has it he made the owner an offer of $1 million, but George Austin declined to sell.  ""

Correction, the Austin's founded a hotel and general store in Jungo, which is a few miles from here. They moved there from San Francisco after living through the 1906 earthquake. It's said the wife was so stressed out from the earthquake that all her hair fell out. 

The Austins bought the right to the Jumbo Mine and made a fortune.

The story is a sad one, a real rags to riches to rags story of one woman, Josie Pearl (the queen of the black rock desert). Some have tried to romanticize Josie's life, but what I see is a sad story of how Josie went from rags to riches, only to go back to rags and die alone in the middle of nowhere.

We were stalked by the Area 51 back gate ""camo goons"", as I like to call them. Remember, we were on public land, that means your land and my land. The camo dudes have no authority on public BLM land. 

It almost seemed like they were extremely bored and enjoying the attention. It's hard to believe a professional security organization working for our government would stalk US citizens on public land the way they are doing around area 51. I have to wonder if it's just a way for them to pass the time.

364,I Can't Believe ALL OF THIS Was Left ABANDONED In The MIDDLE OF NOWHERE...,2016-09-16,1455046,9143,1750.0,"This urban exploration gave us the creeps. Even though you can easily tell nobody has been there in a long time, it felt as if we were being watched the entire time. We found multiple abandoned buildings, a few abandoned trailers, and an abandoned house. For some reason, the area reminded me of the walking dead. 

We also found what we thought resembled a small grave site, about the size of a child or large dog. The site has a small fence that was at one time standing around the site, but the fence is no longer standing. We forgot to get a video of the spot, but it was most likely the grave of a dog. 

We found these abandoned houses while out exploring the deserts of Nevada. 

When we reviewed the video for editing, we noticed what appeared to be two silhouettes watching us from a distance. I am not sure if they were people or just shadows, but you can see them at 12:47. We heard a lot of strange noises while we were there. Definitely a creepy urban exploration.

Some viewers are confused and think we are talking about the white SUV in the video, but that white SUV is my vehicle. The two silhoettes are far behind the white SUV, to the right of it. If you are on a cell phone, chances are you will see nothing.

When I was using the drone to film a shot over the mountain range, I thought I could see something on the mountain. I didn't realize it at the time since my phone screen is so small that you can't really see animals on it. Once I realized they were Bighorn Sheep, I turned the quadcopter around and brought it home and pulled out my video camera.

We found an explosives truck which at one time houses explosives for the mine tunnel. We also found a forgotten mine tunnel and an old miners cabin with graffiti from the 1970's.

Just think, if those who were up there were 20 years old when they signed their names, they would be in their 60's today. Kind of crazy when you really think about how fast time goes by.

369,A Look Inside An ABANDONED Home In The Middle Of Nowhere,2016-08-19,20779,672,89.0,"Whenever I find an abandoned home such as this, I can't help but wonder what happened. Someone once tended the gardens, built a fence around their little piece of heaven, and even added personal touches to the decor. Now it sits completely abandoned, forgotten, and is struggling to make it just one more day. 

Sometimes I can find clues as to what may have happened, but this time I am completely stumped. At least an hour away from the nearest small town, it makes one wonder why anyone would build their little home out here in this harsh environment. But someone did, and now they are gone, and their little home sits completely abandoned and open to the elements. Nature will reclaim it, sooner rather than later. 

This is a home we stumbled upon on one of our explores. It was getting late, but I had to stop and check it out. As you will see, the place is in bad shape, and probably won't be standing for many more years, but at least I was able to stop and check it out, document it before it is gone forever. I only wish I knew the backstory.

Come with us as we explore this creepy ABANDONED cabin hidden in the woods, just outside the desert. This old house was full of stuff, both old and new.

You may be wondering why we would be searching a mine for a fallout shelter. In the 1960's, the government designated certain mines as fallout shelters and stocked them full of survival supplies.

373,DID THE OWNER DIE HERE? Where Did He Go? Why Did He Leave His RV WAY OUT HERE The Middle Of Nowhere,2016-08-04,476379,4734,1236.0,"We came across this abandoned RV in the middle of the desert while urban exploring. Did they die working in their mine? There is nothing around. The nearest town is about an hour away on dirt roads. We were left wondering, where did the owner go? Why would someone leave this behind? 

You could tell the abandoned RV was set up for long term occupancy. You could see the remains of a collapsed building on the side of it, and the old fire pit with chairs around. The only thing in this area are abandoned mines. They clearly set up this RV to use as a mining camp home base. 

For some reason I find abandoned trailers and RV's creepy. Seems there is always some mystery as to why they were just left, and usually the reason is something illegal like insurance fraud or someone getting stuck and vanishing.

I almost didn't stop at this location since most of the buildings were already gone, but I am glad I did. I wonder why all of their possessions were thrown outside and left. It makes me think someone died in the home and they just threw all their stuff outside. What do you think? 

We DO NOT TAKE anything from our explores. As hard as it is to leave stuff like this behind, it's not ours to take. Unfortunately the elements or vandals will probably destroy it.

This place looked like a place where someone would hide out. 

This place is located on Public Land, but we know that sometimes claim holders think they own the land when they have a mining claim. Although we have never run into anyone who has been less than friendly, there always exists the possibility of running into someone with ill intentions in the middle of nowhere.

Nan Dixon went missing in 1978 and has never been found. 4 years later, her vehicle was found in a remote valley near Lovelock, Nevada.

We have located the location where Nan's vehicle was found and searched the area. We have found some interesting stuff in the immediate area of her vehicle. 

The most interesting part is the lack of trash anywhere else in the area. We found no other trash in the area!

Nan's disappearance has remained an unsolved mystery ever since her disappearance. Was she murdered? Did she take the wrong turn and get stranded? 

What we do know is Nan left a note in her vehicle. We reveal this note in this video, and what we think it may have said. The note was in very bad condition and thought to be covered in blood when it was discovered. 

Nobody knows what happened to Nan, but you can come along with us as we try to find her remains. You can even help us in our search from the comfort of your own home when we start releasing our video from the air.

The first few buildings had only a few interesting items inside, but when we got to the creepy abandoned trailer, we got far more than we bargained for. 

The abandoned trailer had all of its windows boarded up and we figured we would not find anything interesting. But upon cracking open the old creaky door, we discovered what appeared to be a hideout of someone who was maybe on the run or who did not want to be discovered. Soon we started finding some interesting stuff. 

Although the trailer wasn't full of stuff, it was full of many personal documents that showed a slow decent into mental illness. If it was a hideout, it would be the hideout of a lunatic. 

During our explore, we felt we were being watched the entire time. It is possible the squatter was watching from the hillside, but we could not imagine anyone actually living here. But they clearly were at one time. 

What you will see is exactly what we seen at the abandoned lunatic hideout.

388,GHOST TOWN Helena California Abandoned 1850's Town,2016-04-16,114300,2718,195.0,"Helena California is a completely abandoned ghost town with many buildings remaining.  The town started in the 1850's and lasted through the 1930's, with the post office lasting through the 1980's. 

In the 1970's, one of the abandoned buildings was completely restored and used as a post office. I am not sure when it closed, but today the entire town is completely abandoned and frozen in time. 

At one time it was literally the end of the road. This is where the highway ended and was end of the line. 

The demise came when the highway was rerouted less than a quarter of a mile away. 

Today only the abandoned homes and buildings remain. If you visit this old ghost town, you can see many abandoned buildings with original wallpaper, architecture, and even an old feeding stables. 

The town reminded me a lot of the ""Little House On The Prairie"" TV show. Sadly the vandals have destroyed many of the original buildings.

389,You Won't Believe How Deep This Mine Shaft Is!,2016-04-09,19876,696,64.0,"This abandoned ghost town is about 3 hours from the nearest town. Remote would be an understatement. After trekking for hours on dirt roads, we finally arrived at the ghost town of Simon Nevada. 

Simon, Nevada started in 1879 as a Lead and silver mine. Due to a power outage in 1931, the mines flooded and the town never recovered. It is said the mines have underground workings of over 25,000 feet! That's a lot of abandoned mine tunnels! 

Another story states that the demise was due to the declining price of silver and lead. Regardless of the reason, the town eventually died and is completely abandoned today. 

There are a few completely abandoned buildings still left. There are also many deep mine shafts and a building full of old ore samples. All of the abandoned homes are all crumbing today. 

The story on why Simon died depends on who you ask, so I have presented you with both stories. 

We did not venture into the mines at this time, but a return trip will be planned in the future where we also take a look into the mine tunnels of Simon.

We received a tip from a fellow youtube explorer Cameron who found the letters years ago in an abandoned mine tunnel. We decide to start our search there and find some very old stuff left behind many years ago. 

A big thank you to Cameron, whose channel you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Cambpro

If you would like to help search for Nan, the location of where her vehicle was found is: 40.29482, -118.7821 

You will probably see us out there as we continue our search for her. 

I would continue down the dry creek bed as I am betting she could have easily walked 5 miles or more down that dry creek bed. Remember, her purse and handgun are still out there. A metal detector would easily be able to pick them up if they are buried out there somewhere. 

There are a two predominant theories as to what happened to Nan. The first is the theory she was murdered. Another theory is she got lost and took a wrong turn. I don't see her driving her car down to that spot voluntarily, but it's worth exhausting all the possibilities when searching for someone

In the area of Tunnel Camp, there have been a few disappearances. In addition to the disappearances, they have found many unidentified bodies of women.

391,HAUNTED ABANDONED GHOST TOWN: Nan Dixon Vanished Without a Trace On Her Way to Tunnel Camp | PART 2,2016-03-27,190683,2804,458.0,"Nan Dixon, age 73, went missing in this abandoned town in 1978. 
We continue to explore this creepy abandoned town in the middle of the night in this part. 

Nan Dixon went missing in 1978 while on a trip to visit her brother. What is known is that Nan's Brother Harry Leighton owed her $6,000. Nan was in need of money and was on her way to collect a debt from her brother. 

Nan was following a map created by her brother. On her way she vanished without a trace. Four long years later, her vehicle was discovered less than 10 miles from where she was going. 

UPDATE: We have been in contact with Harry and Lula's grandchildren, and they have assured me that there is no way their grandparents could have been involved. As this mystery is yet unsolved, there is no way to know for sure if anyone was involved in her disappearance. It has, and continues to be our position that all named suspects and possible suspects are considered innocent unless proven otherwise. 

Tunnel Camp Nevada is a hotbed for paranormal and is considered by many to be haunted. Feel free to fire up google and search haunted Tunnel Camp. 

We visit the town at night to try and locate any clues we can find about Nan's disappearance. We experience many strange things including radio problems, light problems, strange lights, and more. Many would claim it's all paranormal, but we are not ghost hunters or paranormal investigators. We are explorers who enjoy exploring old abandoned ghost towns and buildings. 

Come with us and see exactly what we seen. What you see may shock you or give you chills. 

Nan's granddaughter has been looking for her remains in hopes of bringing them home for a proper burial. 

In the area of Tunnel Camp, there have been a few disappearances. In addition to the disappearances, they have found many unidentified bodies of women. 

We experience many strange occurrences during our visit to Tunnel Camp. Most are probably easily explainable, but we will leave that up to you, the viewer. 

We ARE NOT paranormal investigators or ghost hunters. We are urban and rural explorers. We do not claim that anything in this video is paranormal. We simply leave it up to you to decide. 

Please watch part 1 first if you have not yet done so.

392,ABANDONED Town: Site of Murders & Serial Killer Dumping Grounds? | PART 1,2016-03-10,549683,5924,1061.0,"In 1978, Nan Dixon disappeared when traveling to the area to collect a debt. Her vehicle was found 4 years later in an area already searched by air and land. Inside the vehicle they found a note. In the trunk they found what appeared to be blood stains. 

I need to make a correction: it was Butch, the son of Harry and Lulu, who allegedly may have had something to do with Nan's disappearance. 

UPDATE: We have been in contact with Harry and Lula's grandchildren, and they have assured me that there is no way their grandparents could have been involved. As this mystery is yet unsolved, there is no way to know for sure if anyone was involved in her disappearance. It has, and continues to be our position that all named suspects and possible suspects are considered innocent unless proven otherwise. Our mission is to find Nan and to figure out what really happened to her. 

Nan's granddaughter has been looking for her remains in hopes of bringing them home for a proper burial. 

In the area of Tunnel Camp, there have been a few disappearances. In addition to the disappearances, they have found many unidentified bodies of women. 

We experience many strange occurrences during our visit to Tunnel Camp. Most are probably easily explainable, but we will leave that up to you, the viewer. 

I know there are a few things I need to work on with the next videos, such as completing my thoughts, better audio, etc. We are working on it.

It appears the party ended abruptly at the abandoned brothel as we find many bottles of alcohol still sitting in their dispensers. Of course we continue to find high heels, stilettos, and much more, but it's the bar that we find intriguing. 

The abandoned bar could easily be re-used, but sadly it is rotting away, frozen in time and place. The vandals have shown up and caused their usual vandalism, but it appears they may have been caught in the act. Therefore vandalism has been kept to a minimum, but still present.

As if that isn't cool enough, this abandoned town also has an abandoned playground where children once played, and this place is remote... SO remote the nearest (very small) city is about 2 hours away!

This place dates back to the early 1900's with a very rich history. Fortunately, it's tucked deep into a valley and vandals have not yet discovered this amazing place. I will NOT share the location in order to protect the property from vandals and thieves.

It consists of two small miner cabins, an outhouse, and a massive processing plant. The processing plant looks like you could install power and be back in business in no time! 

What was most striking about the place was the lack of senseless vandalism, something we see far to often at these remote places. This reassures us that not many people get up to this place.  

We hiked up to the first small mining camp and took a short break. Then we made it up to what we were looking for.  We never know what we are going to find when we search and find these places. 

Can anyone date the freezers? Anything else?

Coaldale Nevada is a ghost town which at one time had a cafe, motel, gas station, cabins, and more. Unfortunately today, most of the site has been vandalized by losers who don't seem to appreciate the history of these sites. Therefore not much is left inside the buildings except for trash and human waste. 

Strangely, a lot of people seem to stop here to defecate on the walls! I have no idea how they accomplish that, but they do. extremely strange. 

I tried out my video equipment, but unfortunately it seems to pick up every single thing, especially my breathing. I will have to remember this for future videos, but this time I added some background sound to hopefully make it less annoying. 

We never vandalize or destroy the places we visit. We enjoy exploring old places, especially old ghost towns with buildings to explore. We also like to document these places for future generations as most of them won't be around much longer.

413,ABANDONED CREEPY Ranch and Trailer | Smell of Death in the Air,2015-10-07,331310,3993,433.0,"We found this creepy abandoned ranch house was in one of the most remote locations you can find. The smell of death was thick inside the old abandoned home. 

This old ranch is located in the middle of nowhere. Literally 2 hours away from the nearest small town. We have driven by it many times over the years and finally decided to stop and check it out. We are glad we did as it probably won't be long until it's gone forever. 

From the research I have done, this ranch was built in 1944. It appears whomever lived there had put a lot of work into the small details. I have no information on the residents or what happened to them. 

When we first arrived, we had noticed all of the items from the home had been moved outside. After first I thought it must have been vandals who usually destroy everything they come across. It wasn't until later in the video that we realized it was probably due to the fact that something or someone was dead in the home previously and had been dead there for a while. Therefore someone must have moved everything out, including the floors, in order to try and get the smell removed from the home. It didn't help, but I am sure it would have been much worse had all the doors and windows been closed! 

I have no idea what had died in there, but it seems clear it was definitely something! 

In the trailer you can see what looks to be melted butter in a bowl, as if someone had just up and left in the middle of making something. I have no idea what to make of the place. 

For the record, we NEVER take anything from the places we visit. We only take video documentation in order to preserve the history of the places we visit and share them with you.

414,Rattlesnake In The Nevada Wild Part 2,2015-10-04,12023,336,14.0,"Support our channel by subscribing and get notifications when we upload our new weekly videos. 

When out exploring, we come across a lot of wildlife, and it's always a highlight of our explorations. During this trip, we came across this rattlesnake. 

I apologize for the shaky video as I was trying to get the snake to rattle for the camera. 

One of the big misconceptions is that rattlesnakes will always rattle. The truth is, many times they will not rattle at all. It's best to wear snake boots when out exploring or hiking in areas with Rattlesnakes. 

We never kill or harm the animals we come across in the wild. This snake will live to see another day.

416,CREEPY Abandoned Ghost Town In PERFECT CONDITION | Found Bar But Not A Single Person To Be Seen,2015-08-30,321782,3585,410.0,"We found this abandoned ghost town in the middle of nowhere. This abandoned ghost town in PERFECT CONDITION looks like a Hollywood set and would be a perfect filming location for a TV show like The Walking Dead. 

Today we take a ride into Ione Nevada, a creepy, yet charming little town that resembles a Hollywood movie set. Come with us as we take look around for a resident in a town that boasts a population of 41. 

Ione Nevada is a town located in Nye County Nevada, about 23 miles away from Gabbs. Gabbs itself is pretty close to being a ghost town as well, so this town is literally in the middle of nowhere. Ione came into existence in 1863. 

This is part one as we will head back into this town to try and explore some of the buildings and also conduct a night time visit. 

This town does have residents, so vandals should stay far away from this place as the current residents don't take kindly to vandals. You wouldn't want to be caught vandalizing way out here. No police will come to save you. Of course, if you're a vandal, hopefully you get what you deserve.

Please SUBSCRIBE to my channel and stay up to day with our weekly updates. We add new videos every Sunday. If you visit this town, you will know someone is watching you, but who and where?

417,ABANDONED Ghost Town Of Ellsworth Nevada (FOUND LAST RESIDENTS GRAVE),2015-08-23,47817,1323,140.0,"Abandoned Ghost Town of Ellsworth Nevada, found last residents lone grave site. Ellsworth was at one time a thriving town but is not completely abandoned. Unfortunately vandals have had their way with this historic place and have left it in shambles. 

History Of Ellsworth Ghost Town, Nevada

""ELLSWORTH is in Mammoth District, thirty miles south of the old overland road through the Cold Spring range of mountains, and about twelve miles westerly from Ione. It contains a post-office and stage station. Ore was discovered in 1863 by the Indians, and in 1864, Sam. McKeon, A. T. Hatch, and others, organized a district. 

The town was started soon afterwards, but its growth was slow and discouraging until 1870, when a ten-stamp mill was built. Its population then increased to 200, and it became very lively. Since 1874 the mill has been operated only a portion of the time, and the population of the town has dwindled down to twenty persons, including six miners. 

The quartz veins are found in a formation of granite, which runs northeast and southwest, the veins running with it and dipping to the west at an angle of forty-five degrees. The ores are mostly free-milling, and average about $100 to the ton. The principal mines are the Peoria, Morning Call, General Lee, Silver Wave, Mount Vernon and Lisbon. 

The greatest depth of shaft is in the Mount Vernon, 180 feet. When the mill was in operation, Indians were employed at the pans, settlers, concentrators and furnaces, with a couple of white men to oversee them, and proved very efficient laborers. The cost of wood delivered at the mills, has usually been three dollars and a quarter per cord. Salt is worth thirty-five dollars per ton. Water for the mill is obtained from a forty-foot well. Some very rich ore has been taken from the Esta Buena Mine, located and owned by Don Manuel San Pedro, of Grantsville. 

Some of it has gone as high as $1,600 per ton. Several tons worked in the mill yielded $325 each. The nearest railroad point is Austin, sixty-five miles to the northeast. Freight is brought from Wadsworth at the rate of fifty dollars per ton.""

420,ABANDONED CREEPY GHOST TOWN Full Of Stuff In The Middle Of Nowhere,2015-08-17,647786,5465,755.0,"We found this spooky / creepy abandoned ghost town full of stuff in the middle of nowhere Nevada, hidden and tucked deep into a canyon. 

This place looked like someone had been living there within the last 10 years, but we found no trace of life. But the flies were everywhere! I can't tell you where the flies were coming from, but they were a not a welcome addition to the strange feeling of being watched. 

The last thing you want to run into out here is some strange, irate squatter. There is no help coming if you get into trouble out here. Police would probably take an hour or more to reach the area, and that is if you can get into contact with the police as you have no cell reception at this location. 

This place is at least 100 miles from the nearest city. We had to hike after we reached the end of the road. The remote location has kept away the scum bag vandals and thieves. 

The site is most likely still actively mined on occasion. I can see it must still be maintained to some degree by someone. Not sure who, but most likely the claim owner. Unless it's been recently abandoned, I believe it's still worked on a yearly basis due to the condition of the buildings. 

The newest dated material was from around 1989 or so. This was a real find and we rarely find places as good as this one. 

The newer buildings are most likely illegal as they are on National Forest Public Land, but I will not be alerting anyone as I would hate to see them torn down by the National Forest Service. 

We never remove or take anything from these sites. We like to explore and document them for historical purposes. In addition, we love to explore the outdoors.
