""What was so unique about this story is that it happened in my home town. For me, as a young boy watching '48 Hours,' I dreamt of telling a story in my hometown and this was that. Most often than not '48 Hours' involves tragic endings and deaths, but this was a happy ending for the victim because she survived to tell her story."" — David Begnaud on why this story is important.
