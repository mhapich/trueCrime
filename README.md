# True Crime Channels analysis

In this project, I have started by compiling a list of my favorite YouTube true crime channels and their channel ids. I then used the YouTube API to gather statistics for each channel that I want to analyze.  Eventually, I will include a Tableau dashboard that includes geographical information of the crimes/criminals.

You can find this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mhapich/true-crime-channel-statistics).
