Famous examples of Hollywood Accounting include The Return of the Jedi and Forrest Gump. So What is Hollywood Accounting? In this practice, when a studio is producing a movie creative accountants working will set up the movie as it\\'s own company. The company then charges everything back to the studio (which is making the movie, just not on paper) Then at the end when the credits roll and the ticket revenue rolls in, it doesn\\'t cover what was charged internally, and so makes nada!
